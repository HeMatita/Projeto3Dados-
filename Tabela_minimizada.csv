I've had it for several months (3-16) and it is a nightmare!! It is essentially a HTC M8. It has programming in it which cannot be deleted from China and does not 'hold' updated programmed information from Droid! It randomly does what it wants! Calls people, calls voice mail, flashes, incompatible with bluetooth, won't accept/see additional sim card so it stores everything on the phone's sim which means, you can't take pictures/video, voice record . . . nothing! And, OMG it is so SLOW ON DIALING OR ANYTHING ELSE, it must have been built during the first Apollo Mission to the Moon. A nightmare!!!!! I'm going to attempt to return it to Amazon!!!

I fully recommend it; the only problem was the bad quality of the camera but fixed that with an app and its great. Does work with straighttalk bring your own phone (BYOP) packet. You have to use the att or t-mobile sim cards and you HAVE to call the customer service operators so they can do it. They will tell you its not going to work blah blah blah but it does work I ordered two of this phones and they are working perfectly wih 4G. Only bought one BYOP packet--it comes with three different sim cards so it worked for me so I could activate both phones with one packet. After you activate the service then straight talk sends you a txt so you visit a website link and activate your internet: dont worry its very easy to do.When you first get it remember to remove back cover and remove paper from battery so it wont blink when you are charging it. Its blinking cuz there's something preventing the phone from charging and the phone is telling you that.Read your instructions peopleGood luck with your phone!Thank you.","108","Samsung","8"

Some things are still in Chinese although the language was initially set to be English. this seller have not done the right rooting as it described. But that does not prevent me enjoy the phone until now. Its default setting needs to be customized if you use gophone plan. You MUST turn off the data connection service to avoid automatic connecting and charging for the online time (Could be too late when you notice that).I will add more when I learn using other functions.Just find that when you insert 32G SD card, the machine response very slow.

After my experience with my 1st Lenovo A850, I realize that the cheapest price does not mean the phone is best setup to fit my use. I got this one from PriceAngels. Before I placed my order, I confirmed with the seller on setting the language to English, rooting and installing GooglePlay. The seller was very prompt in getting back to me. For that, I thank you!The phone's screen quality is good (although not as high end as HD) for the price level. The touch response is as good as any high end smartphones. Since this phone has been rooted, I could install any app/tools I want.things for Lenovo A850 should be noted (for good reasons) --1. The FM radio is very clear. You cannot use the FM radio on speaker, you must use an ear piece.2. This phone has a built in GPS. I installed a GPS app that does not need internet connection to the phone. The GPS app has slow responses, so, it is hard to tell how good is the GPS until I try some more. If non-web GPS app works well, then I do not have to use DATA for direction at all. For now, my GPS device will remain in the car...3. Although the phone's language has been set to English, some status updates / indicators on the phone are still in Chinese. This does not bother me. I don't think you can have EVERYTHING set to English or another language.4. The phone boots up to some Chinese mobile company. This is one setting I would love to change but don't know how.This phone still gets 5-star rating from me. This is a great phone and the price is great.","530","Lenovo","1"

I was coming from a galaxy s3. Out of the box I liked the look and feel of it. Turned it on and didn't mind the little bit of Chinese or Japanese writing that still lingerd. Put my sim card in and it powered up fine. Problems started when texting. After about 30texts it stopped displaying new texts. I would get notifications saying I had one but when I went to contact to view it wouldn't allow me to scroll to see them. Then the phone would be on silent mode even if I had selected other wise so I couldn't hear when I received texts. Turned the volume up full and it still didn't work. Next was the internet. Wi-Fi connection was fine when at home or work when it had a network to connect to but not while using AT&T network (my carrier). Tried everything and got somewhat close. Sometimes it would work briefly. After loading for a few minutes a page might display but if you tried to click on a link or the next page it would say no network connection. So no internet on the go or GPS.Also if you were sent a link in a text from a friend or colleague the phone said it didn't have the correct program to continue and wouldn't connect. All in all the phone was just SO GLITCHEY! Every day something new would pop up. Even if the internet worked I just didn't feel safe having this phone as my source of contact to the world, like it would crash at any moment. My s3 just blew this phone away. Even if everything worked right it still didn't stack up. The big screen was nice but not as clear as my S3, and it was so freaking slow loading movies and pictures and web pages.I recommend avoiding this phone and looking into something else. Pay more and get something more reliable.","530","Lenovo","1"

Feels like 10K, looks like 10K, fast and clean. Benefits are there are MANY MANY roms to flash very easily. The phone feels like something you would want to own!The second - I RETURNED IT :-( . First is that you MUST check the ROM kernel. If it does not say ""ROW"" in the file name you will have a headache. Just that simple. But the most important is in does NOT run on the 850MHZ in 3G/HSPDA+. I repeat it is not a 850mhz Penta Band phone in upper bands. What does this mean for you? ATT, TMobile, and MVNOs (straight talk, ect) that run on these networks will ONLY GIVE YOU 2G speeds which are to be disbanded shortly. Very few places, mostly big cities, operate that 2100mhz in USA. So if you want it for USA - sad to say - we are gonna miss out on this one.I give it 4 stars for the fact that its a 10 star phone - but CANNOT be run in ""todays"" markets in the USA.Good luck all.NOTE: Purchased twice - 1st was AXOING = NO ROW, Chinese only!; 2nd - was APlusElek = Old Rom but WAS ""ROW"" so easy enough to work with for Google services.

"203","5.5-Inch Unlocked Lenovo A850 3G Smartphone-(960x540) Quad Core 4GB MT6582m 1331MHz Android 4.2 Dual Camera +Dual SIM -Black (Rooted + Google Play)","161.06","5","This is my second time buying a cellphone from amazon. As always, i did a heavy research BEFORE buying the phone and placing my order.My first impression of the phone was: Holy crap this is beautiful. Its thin, its slick and it is black and shiny all over the place! It is really something to admire.The first thing is: This phone is HUGE. Its totally a thing. And it wont stop being a thing. I mean it is a 5.5 inch screen, which makes this phone almost a tablet, which it is! so it is called a Phablet. The screen is very bright, crisp, and seriously, IPS? in my opinion the best choice for color and brightness,plus it saves battery. People complains that this phone doesn't have a 1080p screen, but really, if you can see the difference between the pixel density of this phone (aprox 200ppi ) and the pixel density of the iPhone (500 ppi) then your eyes must be better than the Kepler telescope. Go work at NASA or some stuff hehehehe. The screen size alone makes up for some things it is missing, and it totally should have, like a magnetometer. But don't get me wrong. This lil fella here is a powerhouse. It will make some phat rhymes and some ill beats for you if you play it rightThe feel of the phone is sturdy. It wont broke easily (nor i recommend you to try and break it. I mean come on) The back case has a good grip. Still i recommend you to get a phone cover, just in case. TPU will do or something more sturdier. I got one from http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EY7SS72/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1It has a LCD screen cover plus the case!!Inside the box, i got the phone (Durrrrr), Charger, Battery, A screen cover !!, a 4 GB micro SD!! , USB Cable, Wall Adapter And some cool earphones. Really complete set in my opinion. It has the bare minimum to go strolling.The charger is of good quality, sturdy, as is the USB cable and the wall adapter.About the Battery. It is a 2250 mAh battery. Now in the last two weeks i only charged the phone once every 2 days. So that gives you an approximate of 2 days of battery with GPS , WIFI and DATA NETWORK on. But that's me, I don't play much with the phone, and my heavy using apps are social ones. There is an application on the phone called Lenovo Power that manages battery in a smart way so it lasts longer. I suggest to learn it and use it.OK, opening the back case is nothing short of easy. It has a little dent to the lower right side that allows you to pull the back case fast and easy.Inside you will find 2 standard sized SIM CARD slots, Micro SD slot up to 32 GB , Phone Camera, Audio Speakers And battery slot. The phone accepts mini SIM CARDS too. Now about the DUAL SIM you must know that the First one(The one on the left) Is able to Use 3G capabilities while the other one cannot. Don't Sweat it, this is standard practice. The second SIM CARD slot will be and shall be used for a second phone line used only for calls. The audio Speaker is of good Quality. And LOUD. Good lord that thing is noisy hehehe.This phone Id is LENOVO A850. Its not a lenovo A820 and it is totally NOT a SAMSUNG GALAXY 2,3 OR 4. Nevertheless it has a bunch of qualities that will prove quite useful.Why do i mention that you ask? It is because of the camera. I kid you not. Its a 5 MP camera. Its a really good camera, but some People might want this phone to shoot pictures at a quality that is beyond the hardware. The pictures are excellent in my opinion and they will work with whats-app and other apps. It has a lot of modes like continuous shooting and auto-focus and you can set up camera quality up to 5 MP. You can record video at high quality too. It seems 1080p But in fact it is scaled from a lesser resolution. Not a problem for me tho. As always, this is a phone, not a camera.This phone has a MT6582M mediatek CPU. It is a Quad-core@1.3 GHz with a GPU MALI-400MP2. What does this Means for you? Its Fast. Trust Me , really fast. Your multimedia will play with no problems and your games will go like silk. Games like NOVA 3 and Anomaly Korea . Cool.It has 4 GB of internal memory that translates in a total of 2.31 GB in real usable space. It has too 1 GB of ram. This will Make the phone faster too, because you will be multitasking a lot with this Phone .Now going to the front side of the phone, you will find in the top The brand of the phone (LENOVO) in shiny silver letters, your 3.5 Audio Plug, power Button ,speaker, frontal camera , proximity sensor and a notification led . The frontal camera is a 1.2 MP one, it wont transmit lots of data to Skype and other apps so its ideal to make video calls. The top speaker Works like a charm as well as the proximity sensor and the 4 colors notification LED (Blue,Red,Orange,Green). I guess the LED is fully Configurable But haven't tried it yet .I will Update As Possible.In the Bottom you will find 3 silver shiny soft touch buttons, micro USB slot and microphone.The soft Buttons are from left to right:Menu Button, Home Button and Go back Button. They are shiny and silver and they wont have BACK-LIGHT. They will be visible enough in the darkness so that's it.The right side of the phone has the +/- volume buttons. The left side has nothing.OK that's with the Physical stuff. Now we go to Software.First Thing First. This Phone posses a high grade of heavy customization. And as such, it is necessary that if you are going to make use it, you are able to at least, follow instructions precisely and know your way around android OS or a computer. Sorry but that's it if you want to customize it. If not, Then don't worry ! Most Sellers are very kind and they will get you (if you ask them of course) the phone in your language be it Spanish or English or whatevs and they will customize it for you. But seriously, ask them. Don{t expect them to do it just for giggles. And certainly, do not ask after getting the phone or placing the order. Before is OK.The software is a tricky thing. My phone came with a Android 4.2.2 Rom that is called S128 Xiaomijie. It was a Chinese ROM but it came in English. I just wiped it and installed another one called S121, made by Linerty. Its more stable for me. Ill post the links At the end for you all that want to customize the phone.There is a silver lining to this. There is an announce from mediatek that this phone will get android 4.4 KITKAT at the end of this month (18/04/2014 as today) so if you go trough with the ROM change you will get the experience needed to update to KITKAT later. All this will be done manually. Bollocks.Anyways, android 4.2 goes really fast in this phone. Man, so FAST. you will get lot of apps that will make your experience with this phone something worth sharing. Your live wallpapers will be smooth, your wireless will be fast and your calls will always go trough. The android integration is really cool and it will save you lots of trouble when you set up your APN's , because at the time you insert your sim card it will get all the info you need for it.The GPS is really exact. you will get accurate measures up to +/- 2 meters. You wont need a internet connection for it to work. Only when you download your maps but apart from that, no.This phone Works Excellently in Venezuela. It works with Movilnet and Movistar (SIM CARD 1) and with Digitel (SIM CARD 2) . That{s for GSM calls. For 3G and data connection its only the SIM CARD 1.Over all, this phone is a great Purchase. I give it 10/10 points because the sheer awesomeness . Have in mind that this is a mid-end phone.And it kicks some rump.About The Seller. It was LightInTheBox. They sent Directly from China Via DHL. It was a Fast shipment (For me). I communicated with themand they were always attentive and fast at answering. Id go with them again in any case.At The time i bought the Phone it was worth 169$ . I guess it will get cheaper so get it if you can :DOne thing You must remember, This is no Samsung S5/S4 Phone, nor an Iphone, Not a tablet. But it will prove reliable with office applications and such .Have a Nice Day !Thanks For Reading This.-18/04/2014-","530","Lenovo","1"

Everyone said it would. It required a sim adapter.So now on to my review.Anyone who gives this phone 5 stars has never owned a premium smartphone. For this review I am comparing to my Samsung Galaxy S5Touchscreen: With the factory provided screen protector on, sometimes its unresponsive, sometimes it freezes. I have to hold down on a touch screen button most of the time for the phone to realize its being touched and then less than half the time the button will respond. Take the screen protector off and it works marvelously, but then you risk damaging the screen.Network: Movistar DigiMobil (pay as you go plan) When I got my SIM I bought a Samsung Galaxy Young 2 to use it in. No major issues aside from phone size. In the young 2 my whatsapp worked fine and I could send texts and make phone calls in my whatsapp on only my mobile network no Wifi. Now that my SIM is in the Lenovo, it will not allow me to transmit in whatsapp at all unless connected to wifi.-In addition, there is no Internet or google play access without wifi.This is a s*** phone and is being returned","530","Lenovo","1"

I've only had iPhones up till now but my 4S is starting to show it's age so instead of spending well over $700 for the iPhone 5C I decided to try out Android because I have a Nexus 7 and like it.This Lenovo A850 had the specs I was looking for and the feedback that convinced me to try it out especially since it only cost a little under $160 on Amazon including shipping.Yeah I had to wait for it to be delivered from China but it didn't take all that long. It did have it's caveats like only 4GB memory storage and 2 of that was a MicroSD card, but after swapping it for a 32GB card and flashing it with a cleaner version of Lenovo's iteration of Android 4.2.2, I'm really enjoying the power and responsiveness of this Mediatek processor. The 1GB of RAM seems ample for my general use but I've watched videos of decent gameing handled by it as well. I also like the battery life but that didn't stop me from buying an extra battery and battery charger since I can just swap out batteries making it never really needing to sit and charge unless I want to.Bottom line is if you know your way around Android even if your just a novice like me, you're gonna really like this phone! Just keep your expectations equal to the price you're paying.","530","Lenovo","1"

Even when logged in to Google Play on the phone's Chrome browser and tried to download its app and other Google Play apps, I kept getting the ""You don't have any devices"" indicator. I checked Google Play's list of compatible devices, Lenovo A850 is one of the supported devices. So, I really do not know why can't and shouldn't I have Google Play on this phone!!!The device, however, came with the Amazon app.Due to limited understanding of its Chinese language apps, I find it difficult to get the most out of this device.Prospective buyer, if Google Play and Chrome are a must for you, I suggest you verify with a seller before buying.","530","Lenovo","1"

If You plan to use the phone outside China, then do NOT buy. The phone is configured to work only in China, even the time/clock on the phone is set to China time zone and you cannot change it. The phone will not accept any changes - you cannot install new apps or make changes to the pre- installed apps - and there are a number of Chinese junk apps pre-installed. The phone will often give you messages in Chinese language. Also, it crashes frequently, and you will get several error messages. It needs to be rebooted frequently. Any changes you made will get lost each time it reboots. Your text messages and contact will even disappear randomly. The battery drains out quickly. Stay away from this piece of junk if you are not living in China.","530","Lenovo","1"

The camera is not bad, the processor is decent. What absolutely ruins this phone is the ADWARE GARBAGE attached to it.The Adware does NOTHING (because the ads themselves aren't even sized properly you don't even know what's being promoted) but slows up the phone. It pops up every so often in settings, launching aps etc. Additionally having used close to a dozen MTK phones Lenovo did a poor job of altering the android OS. It's hard to use, not configurable and clunky.And finally I cannot figure out how to change the MMS settings to consolidate group texts - a known problem with earlier generation android phones.I think those that have the time (I don't) to root this phone will have a much better experience. In stock software form it's not better than the other Android phones on the market - despite the slightly lower price.","530","Lenovo","1"

Or you can use each SIM for different countries services when travelling. The manual and warranty is in Chinese, but it's easy to figure out. It's a phone: Insert battery, Insert SIM, insert micro SD, insert charger cable, charge, tap on Settings. That's pretty much what a quick-start guide will say.The ear buds are cheap.

The large screen is so nice for a old person to read.I downloaded the Wechat I used most from either Lenovo store or Amazon store apps installed on it (sorry I do not remember). I did not find Google play when it arrived.you have to figure out how to change the default Chinese browser into a English one. Some things are still in Chinese although the language was initially set to be English. this seller have not done the right rooting as it described. But that does not prevent me enjoy the phone until now. Its default setting needs to be customized if you use gophone plan. You MUST turn off the data connection service to avoid automatic connecting and charging for the online time (Could be too late when you notice that).I will add more when I learn using other functions.Just find that when you insert 32G SD card, the machine response very slow. Do not recommend to try to use 32G Card.","530","Lenovo","1"

After my experience with my 1st Lenovo A850, I realize that the cheapest price does not mean the phone is best setup to fit my use. I got this one from PriceAngels. Before I placed my order, I confirmed with the seller on setting the language to English, rooting and installing GooglePlay. The seller was very prompt in getting back to me. For that, I thank you!The phone's screen quality is good (although not as high end as HD) for the price level. The touch response is as good as any high end smartphones. Since this phone has been rooted, I could install any app/tools I want.things for Lenovo A850 should be noted (for good reasons) --1. The FM radio is very clear. You cannot use the FM radio on speaker, you must use an ear piece.2. This phone has a built in GPS. I installed a GPS app that does not need internet connection to the phone. The GPS app has slow responses, so, it is hard to tell how good is the GPS until I try some more. If non-web GPS app works well, then I do not have to use DATA for direction at all. For now, my GPS device will remain in the car...3. Although the phone's language has been set to English, some status updates / indicators on the phone are still in Chinese. This does not bother me. I don't think you can have EVERYTHING set to English or another language.4. The phone boots up to some Chinese mobile company. This is one setting I would love to change but don't know how.This phone still gets 5-star rating from me. This is a great phone and the price is great.","530","Lenovo","1"

I went back to my old phone because so much was not working right on this phone and I haven't had time to call to see if it was a phone problem or phone carrier problem. I could call and receive calls, and text and receive texts, but none of the data would work, it wouldn't connect to the internet so I couldn't view anything nor download anything. I got an error with everything I tried. So I put my SIM card back in my old phone for now. When I have the chance, I'll try to see what's wrong with this phone because it seems like a really nice phone, and I love the size of the screen.","530","Lenovo","1"

I've had a Lenovo computer and it was a great device. The phone thus far seems so too. I recently purchased a POSH 5.7 phone that was horrible. Very sluggish and froze. This phone however is very fast is comparison. The phone I was trying to replace with these recent purchases was the Samsung G 3. It was a great phone but after two years and many falls needed to be replaced. This Lenovo feels and looks of the same quality, unlike the POSH. I highly recommend it!

"531","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","292.98","4","Review after 4 days:Pro:-Speakers are bananas-Pulling down the top bar shows a quick preview. Pull down again to show more settings.-Speakers on both sides (on top and bottom).-Battery is fantastic upon buying (great once you start downloading apps). Usually, l phones drain at an average rate and then at 20% it magically drops to 0 in no time. This drains slowly without magical drops even when I have WiFi on and using Spotify and pinterest at the same time at 4%. Good stuff.-Less bloatware: Avg antivirus, Facebook, twitter, chrome, drive, google+, hangouts, weather, WiFi transfer, adobe reader, (NFC) tags, radio, WiFi display, YouTube.-Design of app buttons - not outdated looking.-Pros say the display is meh but it looks good to me.-Double tap screen to wake up. Good if laying flat so you don't have to pick up to press power button.-Don't need to sign in password to access basic pull down settings.-If your phone dies, all the apps open when you turn on, like a computer. Nice-You can uninstall factory apps that are not run by Google. Deleted FB and Twitter, but can't delete YouTube. (Almost) for the win.Meh:-Music: songs overlap 5 secs so you know what song is next.-Camera is acceptable.-Option to pick up in any orientation. I don't need this feature but if your oober lazy/clumsy I guess this could work for you.-Power button is on left and volume is on right. Weird but okay.-Quick access to certain buttons when wake up from sleep like camera, messages, etc.Con:-UI is not intuitive like Apple/Samsung.-Lacks a lot of settings options. No universal settings button like on Samsung.-There's no main home page like on Samsung; when you press the home button, it goes to the last page you were on.-Design of buttons: instead of a backwards play button for 'go back' it is an upside down triangle. Home is a circle instead of a house. Showing all open apps is a square. As a designer, this bugs me because they have no correlation...unless they do corrolate in China.-A sealed battery.-Bottom button bar takes up far too much space and makes screen smaller.-Have to tap each text to the time stamp.-About 4 hrs after unboxing, checked music settings and pressing a song to play in library, it often skips over that song. Sometimes over 1, sometimes as much as six. O thought maybe it was the file type but if you press the backward button (next to pause, not the main), or select play next in queue and press fast forward, it will play. Annoying. Hopefully putting the songs I want into playlists will solve this, unless it skips those too.All in all, acceptable for under $200 compared to iPhone and samsung. I mean really, we are all spoiled. All you really need is call, text, and camera. Use a tablet or computer for all the app bull. Would still rather my SG-S4 because of the user interface, but I get what I need here. (My S4 just up and died on me. Won't turn on. Survived for 3 wks without it)","243","Alcatel","2"

They both have similar dimension and the same screen size. The Idol 3's build quality is very good and it just doesn't feel like a budget phone. I absolutely love the screen for its resolution and color. This came from someone who have used LG G4 and Motorola Moto X and Moto G. This phone is not the fastest out there but it is smooth enough for every day use. I didn't experience any delay so far unlike BLU Life One 4G LTE (2015) which I returned for sluggish performance. I would recommend Alcatel ONETOUCH IDOL 3 4.7"" to anyone who doesn't like all those huge 5.5"" phones out there but rather has a small easy to handle phone.","243","Alcatel","2"

When I woke up, I noticed it was glitching very badly between my PIN lock screen and the home screen dashboard. My touches did not register. I couldn't even make it go into a hard reset.Fast forward one hour later -- it had stopped holding a charge. The phone died pretty hard and at a time I was least expecting it.Fast forward some more -- I attempt to RMA the phone. Their website isn't very intuitive when it comes to finding a repair center. Eventually I find their US repair center. I start filling out the forms, but then I realized I couldn't grab my phone's IMEI and chalked it up as a $175+ loss. Fortunately I have the budget to grab a new phone, but that's still a lot of money to spend on a phone just to have it stop working after a month of moderate use.It's a shame, because for the price, it's a snappy little phone. I liked their UI, and it was fairly close to stock Android. Way better than anything with Touchwiz shoved on it, that's for sure. The camera wasn't that great, but I was willing to live with that. I may grab another one just because I liked the UI so much, but I am going to be very weary and much more proactive about keeping the proper warranty info.Maybe it would just be worth getting a Moto G instead.","243","Alcatel","2"

"536","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","292.98","5","Pros-Smooth Performance-All Day Battery Life-Excellent Build Quality-Good Quality Screen-NFC (Android Pay Compatible)-Decent Camera-MicroSD ExpansionCons-Awkward Button Placement-Squeaky Vibrating Motor-Updates not guaranteed-No Gorilla GlassShould you buy: YESActual Value: $220I loved my Moto G. It made me always question why people spend over $600 on phones when a $200 could work just as well. With the new Moto G, I was willing to buy it right on the spot. But what turned me off was the nearly 3 weeks I’d have to wait for one to be delivered. So I started my search for the next best phone under $200, which lead me to this phone. I’ve had some experience with Alcatel phones, so I didn’t have much expectations with this phone. That being said, I’ve had a couple of days with it and I can say with absolute confidence that I love it.-Design-This is one light phone. I’m starting with that because you have no idea how light it is until you hold it in your hand. I actually thought for a moment that the battery wasn’t inside it yet. But it is pleasant to hold in the hand. The design is all plastic, so don’t expect anything premium on this phone like metal. But it is solidly built, rivaling even the Galaxy S5 in build quality. Speaking of which, this phone is lighter and slimmer than the S5. If the phone were sold for more money, I’d still be satisfied. It’s not just good build quality for the price. It’s excellent build quality. Period. The chrome accent is a nice touch and the speaker grills are slightly angled towards the phone, which add a bit of sparkle to an otherwise black phone. No soft touch plastic on this phone, but it does land on a middle ground where the plastic is nice to touch and is resistant to fingerprints. The design is completely symmetrical, which is important for a certain feature that is unique to it. I’d love it even more if it were available in a different color such as white, but that is personal preference. Overall, I can’t find much to complain; especially for the low $180 price.-Performance-If you have seen the Moto G’s specs, you’re pretty much getting the same hardware. It uses a Snapdragon 410, 720p display, microSD expansion, Android Lollipop, and even the same camera module (Sony IMX 214). However, there are a few key difference that make this a better phone than the Moto G. For instance, this phone has 1.5 GB of RAM (Moto G=1GB), actual front facing stereo speakers, a 4.7” compared to the 5”, NFC, and 16GB of storage(Moto G=1GB). In benchmarks, I have gotten similar results to the Moto G in both CPU and graphic performance. But benchmarks are only one side of the performance experience. The other is daily user experience. Based on the couple of days with it and after installing many apps, I can tell you that this phone is snappy. It’s not as fast as the current flagship lineup, but it never lags or clips the graphics. Apps open relatively quickly and the animations are smooth, as well as the transitions from one app to another. In my testing of multitasking ability, it opened Chrome, Angry Birds, Pokemon Puzzle, and YouTube with no lag and each app open where I left them off. Opening more will force the phone to suspend one of those apps to save RAM, but 4 apps at once without closing is pretty good for the cost. Games also perform good, as long as you have reasonable expectations. 2D games such as Angry Birds, Pokemon Puzzle, and Clash of Clans run smoothly and without an issue. Other games like Asphalt 8 and Real Racing 3 will run smooth, but not at the highest quality setting. But that’s to be expected from a midrange phone. Signal quality is good. I was able to get 62 Mbps download speed and 8 Mbps upload on T-Mobile’s 4G LTE around Pasadena, CA. Thanks to band 12 support, cell signal in buildings is good with the signal almost never going under 3 bars. The speakers are also amazingly good and loud, coming close to matching HTC’s Boomsound phone speakers thanks to the help from JBL. Overall, it performs close to flagship specs, albeit a bit slower. Most people should be happy with this phone.-Display-The phone itself has a beautiful HD display with a 312 PPI (note that the iPhone 6 has a 324 PPI) and it is advertise as being calibrated by Technicolor. While they aren’t at the S6’s quality display, it does come close. The display has a nice color calibration, with vivid colors and nice blacks and whites. It is also bright enough for using even in direct sunlight and the good contrast means you can clearly see what you are doing. It isn’t perfect since there are a couple of issues. The colors do have a VERY slight cool tone, meaning that the whites do have a TINY bit of blue to them. Another small issue is that there is a slight amount of light bleed on one side of the displace. But it isn’t noticeable in daily use and it is good for the price of the phone. One crucial one is the fact that they aren’t using Gorilla glass on this display, opting for the more discreet Dragontrail Glass. Since this is going to be my daily driver, I didn’t want to test the toughness (if Alcatel provides me a unit, I’d gladly test it) but I’ve looked into it and it trades scratch resistance for toughness. It might be easier to scratch it, but it is more resistant to shock. Only time will tell and I will update this review as time moves on.-Camera-The camera is a back-facing 13 MP camera and a front, wide angle 5 MP camera. The rear camera uses a Sony Exmor IMX 214, which is the same unit found in the new Moto G and the more expensive Nexus 6. The results are mixed though. On one side, outdoor pictures are good. Whenever there is good lighting such as outside or a well lit room, the pictures do come out high quality with colors mostly accurate and the camera absorbing a lot of details. However, during the night, the picture quality takes a hit, with the camera struggling to get any details from the lack of light. It will get some details if they is ANY type of light, but not much. The lack of OIS also contributes to this issue, but there is no phone with OIS at this price range at the moment. The flash is okay, but since it isn’t a dual tone unit, the light tends to overflow and photos tend to lose their details. Videos are also a similar story, with good lighting providing good results and the opposite being true. There is EIS, but the effect isn’t that noticeable and it doesn’t really help with the quality. This isn’t a camera you’re going to use for important, memorable moments. But for things that most people use, like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, it works great. This is especially true for the front facing camera, with the selfie cam grabbing a lot of details, provided there is good amount of light.-Software-This is basically running a close to stock version of Android Lollipop. It is running version 5.0.2 with a Stagefright patch already added to protect the phone from foreign attacks. There are a few changes to the software. For instance, the icons look like similar to the iPhone, which can be both a good and bad thing, depending on whether you love or hate that style. Other than that, everything works just like stock Android. Except for one feature that I’m surprised isn’t universal to all phones. That is the fact that this phone is reversible. It doesn’t sound as exciting as fingerprint sensor, but it is a rather practical and underrated feature. I’ve answered the phone to test the sound quality and it wasn’t until after I hung up that I realized the phone was upside down. It sounds equally good on either orientation and it is brilliant. Of course, if you don’t like this (for some reason) there is always the option to turn it off. Overall, the light touch that Alcatel added onto Android hasn’t hurt it much and any problems can be easily fixed.-Conclusion-I wasn’t expecting to get a high quality phone, especially after my experience with an old model that I can’t even remember the name. But Alcatel did deliver a high quality experience and an astonishing device. It does have some compromises, but Alcatel chose them wisely and the overall result is great. There is a couple of phones that compete in this range, but the biggest one is the Moto G. Is this better? Yes and no. For power users, I would still recommend the high end Moto G because of the extra RAM or even a OnePlus One, which is on sale now for $299. But if it must be under $200, like for college students like me, this beats the $179 low end Moto G due to the higher quality speakers, display, NFC, and the slightly more RAM. This phone helps to answer the question: Do people really need to spend over $800 on a phone to get a high quality experience? The answer for most people is no. They don’t. There is a market for people who need to have the latest and greatest with all the new extras like fingerprint sensor and DSLR-like quality cameras. But for the rest of us, there are phone that does what we ask from it and reasonably well not just for the price, but just overall. If you are on the fence and frustrated from searching like I was, let me help you. Go for this phone and you won’t be disappointed.","243","Alcatel","2"

"539","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","292.98","5","As of late I've been on something of a ""phone journey"". I first purchased an Idol 3 5.5"", but the phone was just too darn big to be practical (at least for me). I returned it, and then picked up the new Moto G 2015 (which I also did a review on). It was an excellent phone, but in the end I discovered it was missing some key features that I really needed in a daily driver device.First, the Moto G was missing a notification LED. Sure, some of you may think ""who cares, it has Moto display"", but there are times where this just isn't optimal. When the phone was on my desk and I happened to miss a notification (which normally flashed 3 times, but sometimes just once, probably bugged), to find out I even had one I had to either 1.) reach across the desk and wave my hand over the device, 2.) pick it up which would activate the screen (which didn't always work, either), or 3.) physically hit the power button. A notification LED eliminates the need for all of that fuss. That light is going to blink until I check/clear my notifications, for me this is PERFECT!Moto G is also missing a gyroscope. Not overly important to me (most of the time), but this is useful for things such as 360 degree YouTube videos, certain games, etc. Another win for Alcatel!Moto G doesn't include a magnetometer. Wanna use a compass app on the Moto G? Too bad, so sad. Alcatel 3 - Motorola 0.No NFC on the Moto G. Wanna pay using Android Pay in the future? Well, you can't do that with the Moto G! Idol 3 strikes again!Only 8GB internal storage on the similarly priced Moto G. What's that? You want 16GB for 179.99? Don't worry, Alcatel has you covered.Moto G only offers 1GB RAM on the 179.99 model. While 1GB is ""sufficient"" with careful usage, I'll gladly take 1.5GB for the same price, thanks Idol 3!The screen. While their resolutions are the same (1280 x 720), the Idol 3 4.7"" sports a 312 PPI pixel density, while the Moto G only comes in at 294. More pixels? More clarity? Yup! I'll take it!Dual front facing speakers with JBL sound? They sound absolutely amazing. The Moto G at least had the decency to have its only speaker on the front, but there is zero contest here. These speakers sound just as good as the ones from the 5.5"" Idol 3!While there are more positives, I just wanted to lay out the comparisons between the Idol 3 4.7"" and the Moto G 2015 1GB model, as these are the most often compared devices. In my honest opinion, there is zero contest between the two and I feel that Alcatel did an amazing job on this device. At first I was a bit leery of the 1.2Ghz Quad Core CPU, but I've had zero issues with lollipop and everything is buttery smooth! I fully recommend this to anyone, as it is well worth the price of admission!","243","Alcatel","2"

I was ultimately swayed by the Alcatel because they had the 4.7"" screen size option and I am glad it worked out well.It was very easy to learn and use, great camera, decent battery life, and my mom loves it. The only comment I have to add, is the limited options for changing the language. There were a couple of options, but Chinese was not one of them. If language settings are a top concern for purchasing this phone, I would suggest you to find out what options you would need. (I know the Moto G offers a couple more languages, including Chinese.)

If Alcatel eliminates great features like this after purchase it eliminates my trust in the company and I would not buy an Alcatel product in the future because of this. I don't particularly care if this was intentional or is just a bug. They sent an update patch that changed something I don't want changed. That's a screw up and I'm not happy.░░░░░GOOD PHONE / OKAY CAMERA░░░░░I got this for my wife to replace the Galaxy S6 we bought a few months ago. Turns out that phone was just too darn big. The Idol 3 4.7"" version ends up being perfectly sized for a normal person’s hand.This is a nice phone in general. It's a great phone when you factor in the price and overall value. With the hardware being so capable for such a reasonable price this phone could be a game changer for the Smartphone industry, forcing the major players to bring pricing down. I said the same thing about the 5.5"" version of the Idol 3 a few months ago and with the popularity that device and the ASUS ZenFone 2 are enjoying in this price range, I am convinced you'll see more reasonably priced phones from the major market players in the next 2 years.░░░░░THE GOOD░░░░░❖ The sound - The front facing JBL speakers make this a solid rival to the HTC One M9. If you use your phone for multi media like watching videos or listening to music without headphones this is a solid sound system for you. The sound is vibrant and most importantly it's loud. And it's clear sound. It doesn't sound like a tiny cell phone speaker. It sounds like a real speaker. The HTC One product line made the front facing speakers it's calling card and no one really challenged the HTC design until now. The Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 stands toe to toe with the HTC One sound and doesn't flinch.❖ It physically looks like a nice phone, not a cheap off brand.❖ It's not the most powerful processor in a Smartphone, and it's a little lower powered than the 5.5"" variant but it's plenty good enough to drive the Idol 3 for normal daily use. I didn't find it to be laggy at all doing normal stuff. Through all of the set up process and a couple hours of use there was no lag.❖ It has expandable storage! Thank you for keeping this feature in a smart phone. I hate the cloud. I want to have my files on my device. The Idol 3 starts at 16GB on board (not all usable as the system takes up some of that) but it's expandable up to 128GB via the tried and true SD card method. So you can expand the storage significantly for $20-$50. Meanwhile some of the higher end Smartphones will charge you more than the entire purchase price of the Idol 3 to increase from a 32GB base model to a 128GB model.❖ The HD 4.7"" display is VERY nice. The colors are vibrant. They may be slightly more vibrant than true life colors, but it works. Photos look richer, even if you don't get true life coloring. All the rendered graphics look fantastic due to the rich color depth. (Meaning stuff like your icons and games and the UI interface, etc etc). The resolution is a little lower than the 5.5"" version, but the screen is also smaller so it's not very noticeable. This phone sas the same resolution as the 30 inch HDTV in my bedroom.❖ The back is flat! I like to lay my phone down on a desk or table next to me and be able to use it for things like checking a sports score or just checking off a notification or something. With a rounded back on the phone it will wobble and be annoying. The Idol 3 has a flat back so it lays flat on the table and doesn't wobble when you touch it. This is such a simple thing but it's HUGE for me.❖ It’s SUPER thin. (See my picture with comparison next to my finger) It’s thinner than my Galaxy S4, with just a slightly smaller screen. (Its’ significantly smaller than screen on the Galaxy S6 we sold) And it’s very light weight.❖ The camera was an initial area of concern for me. Everything looked over exposed and blurry. This was largely fixed with an alternate camera app (more on that later). It's still not the greatest camera in the world, but I have to factor in the price tag on the phone. For $180 it's a good enough camera. In high light (outdoors in day time) it's actually pretty decent. In low light (anytime you need the flash) it's not so hot.░░░░░THE BAD░░░░░❖ The stock camera app is complete garbage in all aspects. You can improve the photo quality a little by adjusting the manual settings, but you lose the settings as soon as you restart the app. It doesn't save them. On the stock settings everything is massively overexposed with the light balance making everything look blue. This almost caused me to return the phone, making me think the camera itself was bad. Plan on using an alternate camera app. I switched to Camera MX for photos. (Available on Amazon, but newer versions on Google Play) Camera MX has a conflict with video on this phone though and simply doesn't work. The stock camera app works okay for video.❖ The battery is not replaceable. They do wear out after a while and I like to keep phones for years and repurpose them for other things after their service life as a phone expires. (As controllers for things, MP3 jukeboxes, etc) I like being able to go on Amazon, spend $20 on a replacement battery and quickly switch it out. Additionally, even if you don't keep your phones that long, batteries fail sometimes. So no replaceable battery is a problem for me. This might not be an issue for you. If not, great! But be aware of the issue before making purchase decisions. I sucked it up on this one because it's my wife's phone and she didn't care. But I don't love this industry trend.░░░░░THE BOTTOM LINE░░░░░❖ It EASILY outperforms it's $180 purchase price. It's not the greatest Smartphone of all time, but you cannot beat this phone for $180. I said the same thing about the 5.5"" version's $250 price. The 4.7"" isn't as good of a phone overall as the 5.5"" which has more physical room in the housing to cram in better specs, but for $180 the 4.7"" version is a great value, even with the camera not being an industry leader.❖ Ultimately you have to decide what features are important to you. If you never use the camera or don't use it for anything you want to keep, like maybe you just take pictures of your parking space so you remember where you parked, it's a great smartphone. I love the form factor of it. It's thinness. It's weight. It's display. It's all very nice.❖ Use an alternate camera app that gives you more control over the exposure. An alternate camera app changed my decision to return this phone. I had this as a 4 star review until I had better luck with different apps. I also compared the quality of the photos to the price tag of the phone and realized that it's a great value. You can get a better camera on a phone, but it will cost more to do it. For $180 you really can't go wrong.","243","Alcatel","2"

From the form factor to the amazing front firing speakers to the intuitive stock android lollipop interface. I am using it on cricket wireless and everything just worked right away once i popped my sim card in. Wifi and LTE reception are on par or possibly superior to the LG G2 i replaced. Battery life on standby isnt quite as good as my G2, but while actually using the phone (watching videos especially) it mops the floor of the G2 in terms on on screen time. This is due to the lower res (but still very nice) screen and lower power snapdragon 410 CPU. Dont let the lower power fool you, ive yet to run into any scenario the phone hasnt performed just as well as my G2, which on paper is twice as fast. Just a heads up to buyers of the 5.5"" model (too big for my tastes, but seems to be the preferred size nowadays) is that it is coming to cricket wireless nov 6th for 149.00 bucks, 100 bucks off retail. Mind you it wont be unlocked, this would just be for people using cricket, and as a cricket customer i have only good things to say about them (they use ATT towers, they are the best MNVO by miles).The only con i can come up with on the phone is that it does not beep at you when fully charged, but the LED light goes off after its been at 100% for a couple minutes. I remedied this with an app called Gsam for the app store, now my phone beeps when it hits 100% :)In my opinion this blows away the competition (looking at you moto g) for the money, 16gb storage and 1.5gb memory really put it head and shoulders above other phones in this price range. Not to mention the better screen, absurdly loud speakers and overall dainty form factor (for a phone in 2015).Trust me, you will not regret this purchase, especially if you are looking for a phone under the ""norm"" 5""+ form factor.","243","Alcatel","2"

It's a breath of fresh air from all these phablets and near phablets. I guess I'm in a minority for wanting a smaller phone. Battery life is great and performance is really good. I can't see any lags navigating through menus. I don't play games on my phone so I'm not sure how good the graphics processor. It has outstanding standby time. The screen is great even under sun light. The phone is very light and it produces incredible sound from its dual stereo front facing speakers. The screen is very crisp despite not being 1080P (not a knock, anything below 5"" screen doesn't need a 1080P screen). I've had the 5.5"" version but found it a bit too big for my taste. This phone is perfect, it's even a tad bit smaller than an iPhone 6/6S. 16GB is fine paired up with my 64GB Sandisk memory card. I didn't even think about the Moto G 2015 because with 16GB it's already close to the Idol 3 5.5"" ~$250 price. I'm not so worried about updates.

So we have good connections in what has been a blackout area for years.I upgraded my text system to the MySms premium for better texting and easier texting pictures to family and friends.I added Camera MX for better picture taking and ease of transmitting pictures with the MySms as noted above. The system works seamlessly with Amazon Prime Photos. Take a picture. In a short time it is on Amazon Prime, and I can text the photos to our friends and family in seconds. I have just scratched the surface with the capabilities of Camera MX, and it surpasses any phone camera or camera I have had in over a decade.The battery continues to be amazing and also eliminates the drain on my Android tablet / Chromebook with the MySyms connection.So this great phone fits in my pockets is powerful and does anything I need or want with the phone, internet connection and camera +4G LTE!The cost of this is about $200.The first part of the below is for Tracfone customers/users. If you don’t use Tracfone, go below the dotted line for my review.For a week, my new Alcatel Idol 3, 4.7 didn’t work with my transferred Tracfone minutes and years of use. The Tracfone site showed that my BYOP transfer had worked with my new BYOP sim card, and all of my minutes, data and time left were transferred. The phone didn’t work to make/receive calls or texts.Alcatel was of no help. A friend suggested that I email Tracfone to set up a phone call with them. I did and got online, with someone as per the email from them. He claimed they didn’t have any of my data. Including tracfone phone # and id #’s. Fortunately, I had made a hard copy of what I had re time and years on my old smartphone and what Tracfone showed with my new Sim cardI told him that I needed to speak with someone, who could help me. Then on hold for 15 minutes, when a nice woman answered and again wanted all the data I had emailed and told the other phone person. After, I re told her the specific data, reading from my hard copy made the day the BYOP was supposedly activated. Then, she said I didn’t have anytime left on my contract, and I need to buy more time. I reminded her of the hard data showing over 2000 minutes and time of agreement for years to come. That was a 30 minute + call process.She said that she had to transfer me to another supervisor. She did, and the new person started asking for my data given twice that call. I said that I had sent all of that in via email, and I had given that data twice on the same phone call. She found my contract and said my phone wasn’t 4.7 working because my time/minutes/data hadn’t been transferred. She did her thing on her end and my phone fired up and I dialed in the code to activate it.It now works with well over one hour on the phone going over same stuff 3 times with Tracfone on line people------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Evaluation of this phone is now 5 stars.Before, I got my Tracfone problem corrected, I had used my new phone via wifi to transfer the contacts, pictures and apps from my old android LG phone. Most of this went well. The transfer of stuff from a nearby or close Android (Acer tablet, old Android phone and my Acer Chromebook 15, which I’m using for this report), didn’t work.The wifi reception is good but not as strong as my wife’s Alcatel One Touch Android. Where I use it at home, the wifi reception is strong and very fast.The 4.7” screen fits in my shirt pockets even after the bottom half of the add on hard case was added.The screen size is adequate for what I want to do away from home, to make/receive phone calls and text/receive and check texts and emails. I will use my Acer 8 tablet or my Chromebook for more involved keyboard/screen work at home.The battery, so far is adequate so far for my uses. Last night it was @ ¾ charge, and I didn’t charge it. This morning it was still @ ¾ charged and again at 2 pm this afternoon. When, I picked it up again and turned it on it was still at 3/4.Bloatware is at a minimum.It accepted my 64 gig card with no fuss.The Android 5.0 seems to be smoother and less drag than our previous 4.?.It works smoothly with MY SMS which I have on my tablet and Chromebook.Also, when you receive a phone call, you don’t push or make contact directly with the phone Icon. You have slide that Icon to the right to answer. I have had cell phones since the 1990’s, and that is different.Since the phone is now working with Tracfone, I have to push the app buttons on the screen harder than before.The glass add on screen I bought is too big. The standard screen gets very messy very quickly with minimal useage. I will try to find an aftermarket glass that fits.The combo hard case and belt case (extra buy) is a mixed picture. The hard case fits fairly well;however if you attach that to the other half of the hard case, you can’t really get the camera out to make phone calls, receive them or to take a picture. You have to remove the part that covers the phone and the back part of the case. I missed two phone calls from my wife due to this time delay to get to the front of the phone. Also, I didn’t get a picture of some on the move wildlife in our area due to this problemIf you use Tracfone BYOP, and your phone doesn’t work. Don’t waste your time contacting Alcatel. Send Tracfone an email with your data and tell them your phone isn’t working. Tracfone will send you an email with a phone# and a numeric code to use. When you, make that call, sit in a comfortable chair and have a hardline phone available, all of your data available, a bottle of water, a lot of patience, and your well charged Alcatel Idol 3. I used my Acer Chromebook to help with the data, the “lost” data and other stuff they needed.In this short time, I think that Alcatel and Tracfone have a good winning combo. If you use Tracfone’s BYOP, and you are an established customer wanting to transfer your minutes and time, be sure to make hard copies of your minutes and data. You will probably need that data.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update re the battery. It is an excellent battery with heavy use. It is the best cell phone battery, we have ever owned re standby. It holds the charge in standby versus our other androids phones and tablets using the battery charge overnight or just standing unplugged.Re wifi connections. It quickly recognizes our home wifi and connects and other hot spots seamlessly. Its wifi range in our house isn't as good as my wife's Alcatel One Touch Popup, which is incredible re its wifi range. However, since I never use these phones in our bedroom and a few other weak wifi areas, that is not an issue. The auto switch from wifi to Tracfone 4G LTE like going from our family room to our back yard is auto and seamless. So far the Tracfone/AT&T 4G LTE in our area is very strong and reliable. Hopeoufully, we can try the AT&T 4G LTE in/on our coastal areas where our Verizon/Trackfone coverage is zero.The Android 5.? seems to be more reliable and easier to do simple things with versus the Android 4.?'s.","243","Alcatel","2"

I came from having a moto g, and I think you really do get what you pay for. After 3 months with this phone, I am counting it as a loss and going back to Motorola. It takes 3x longer to do anything you need to do on this phone. The keyboard is not responsive and poorly calibrated, the speakers aren't great, and there are no compatible apps that compare to Motorola assist. Making phone calls takes about three extra steps, and I rarely am able to make or receive calls due to poor reception. I would blame that on the phone service company, but my boyfriend and I are on a family plan and he gets reception when I don't. The text message app is horrible, I downloaded a new one to make it usuable. This phone would be a good starter phone for a teenager, but that's about it. The speakers are bad enough that I have to use speaker phone to make calls (I'm 25)","243","Alcatel","2"

"605","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","292.98","4","Have only owned it for about a week. Battery saver is excellent for me but if you're walking around with the phone in your pocket, it will detect motion and may not sleep as you might expect. Mine sits on a table much of the day and so it sleeps soundly. :-) Speakers are nice JBL but bass response is still lacking which is inherent in the extremely thin design of this phone. You may need to install an equalizer to reduce mid and high frequencies for a richer sound. I would have given 5 stars except that there is a small ""sweet spot"" when listening on a phone call. If the phone is not placed just so on the ear, the volume is reduced significantly. I think it just takes some practice. The dual speakers and dual microphones work beautifully for quickly answering phone upside down if necessary. FM radio will not run unless earphones are plugged in as they act as an antenna. Display is perfect for me. Some built in wallpapers look pixelated but they're probably just crappy samples. As you'll see with Android 5, you cannot have a different wallpaper on your lock screen. So much for using it as a quick flashlight like I did with my old phone.Android 5 does come with a flashlight hidden in the SECOND pull-down notification menu with the Bluetooth and WiFi buttons. The flashlight is not an ""app"". Note: WiFi does NOT turn on using the ""WiFi Display"" app. You must use either the settings menu or the second pull down menu to do that. This phone has an auto-dimming screen which also automatically brightens to max when in sunlight. VERY nice feature but you may find that a nearby light source in a dark room could fool the sensor and make it dimmer than you want it. Just adjust the angle of the screen so that the sensor detects the light and the screen will brighten accordingly. You can also turn this feature off.This is not a ""department store"" brand. They are sold at T-Mobile stores and I was told by a clerk that the Idol 3 is really nice and they don't have it to sell because they were sent a lesser version by corporate.Almost forgot to mention the most important thing; This phone is an upgrade from my 3 year old Samsung which was loading pages agonizingly slow. This Alcatel with Android 5 and LTE loads pages almost instantly! AND this phone is eligible for the Android 6 Marshmallow upgrade as soon as it is available. No luck yet trying to upgrade but I love it! Marshmallow will allow you to override permissions for each app. Other than that, not much change.If you sign up for an Amazon Signature card like I did, you can get an extra $50. off this phone. BEWARE: Amazon automatically changes your default payment method to the new card! If you don't want that, go to your settings and change it back to your old card. Also, the phone must be purchased with the Amazon card to get the discount. So remember to pay off the card right away if you don't want interest charged. You have 21 days grace period. I've had this card before. Keep an eye on your default payment before you check out because it was changed on me once before without my knowledge before making a purchase. One-click ordering is what caused it to happen to me as it does not give you an opportunity to see your default payment method.","243","Alcatel","2"

It outshines my old iPhone 4s battery life by miles.First the cons: I do not like that the wake up/power button is directly opposite of the volume bar switch. The iPhone wake button is much better placed. I also do not like that you have to bring up settings and then ringtones and then scroll to None click on it and then click OK to turn off the ringer and use only vibrate, here again the iPhone has it beat hands down with the little switch on the side.Now the Pros: The screen is really nice and much easier to keep clean that the iPhone, the operating system has IPhone beat hands down, the speaker system is really much more that I expected from a device this small and, to top it off you can answer it from either end with the reversible microphone. The battery life is really great compared to my old iPhone4s. Over all this phone rates about a solid 95%.I am using it on Wal-Mart's family plan which is serviced by T-Mobile and the signal is not quite as good as Verizon was with my old iPhone but it the service is acceptable for what I use it for. I do feel tho it would be stronger on AT&T snd I may at some point switch to them but for now it is serving my purposes well.","243","Alcatel","2"
"614","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","292.98","4","I've had ZTE AWE, LG G2, iPhone 5s, Idol 3 5.5"" and now Idol 3 4.7"".This phone is slim, light, and perfect size for the pocket and web browsing. The Idol 5.5"" was too large to keep comfortably in my pocket without breaking it.The screen has a yellower white, which I like better for reading. The screen of the Idol 5.5"" had a bright bluish white, which often hurt my eyes. Both screens are very reflective - remedied by a MATTE screen protector by Mr. Shield.The battery is 2000 mAh, which to my surprise is sufficient to stream Pandora on 4G the whole day. I always thought that I needed 3000 mAh for a whole day operation but the new version of Android is surprisingly battery efficient.The sound from the phone speakers is loud and clear with some depth, but definitely not with super bass or ""like from big speakers"", as some reviews are claiming. Strangely, the ringing and notifications are decreased in volume when headphones are plugged in - definitely a software bug that Alcatel has to straighten out.While the sound through the on-board speakers is good, JBL did an exceptionally poor job with the sound enhancement through headphones, for which I am removing one star. Most cheap earbuds (less than $20) that I tried with the Idol 3 sounded with weak bass. Turning on the JBL ""audio effects"" attempts to create surround sound by distancing/depressing the mid frequencies, corresponding to human voices. That results in decreased clarity and ""muddy"" sound. The included JBL earphones were the worst from the bunch I tried with no clear highs and a complete lack of bass. I would not pay even $5 for those. Only the earbuds that came with my iPhone 5s had crystal clarity and after I pumped the bass with the Bass Booster app, the sound became acceptable and listening to Pandora enjoyable.A pleasant surprise was the back (13 Mpx) f/2.0 aperture camera, which is the same in the 4.7"" and the 5.5"" models. Its Automatic mode takes good pics in good light. The Automatic is not smart enough in low light so I turn on the Manual mode, set timer to 5s to avoid camera shake, and ISO to about 800. With these manual settings, I was able to get sharp selfies (can see my skin pores) without much noise even in very dim light (indoors, early in the morning on a cloudy day). In comparison, the iPhone 5s automatic mode rarely produced sharp pics in dim light (like indoors during the day), while LG G2 got them but smeared all fine details like eyelashes and skin pores due to agressive noise reduction. The pics that I get with the Idol 3 come out with colors close to what my eyes see with slight saturation of reds. In comparison, LG G2 had a tendency to produce washed out (bluer) pics.In terms of everyday tasks, the 4.7"" Idol 3 is just as fast as the 5.5"" version, and is even faster in the animation when you close all open apps and they slide off the screen one by one. The 5.5"" version stutters in that ?! The 4.7"" Idol 3 has slower processor on specs but has to control fewer screen pixels or is better optimized. I rarely play games on phones so can't compare the two phones in that department. Both phones stutter when browsing the DESKTOP version of image-intensive web pages like Amazon but even my powerful desktop computer does that. It has more to do with downloading all the images and the site programming than with how fast the phone video processor is. The occasional slight stutter does not defray from pleasant web browsing.","243","Alcatel","2"

"619","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","292.98","4","Unlocked phones were never this good before. As a phone it works great. The camera is good in daylight, not so good in dark settings, but for the price that's fair. The screen itself looks very good, way better than the run of the mill budget phones. The speakers are fantastic. Alcatel has a partnership with JBL and you get a very decent set of JBL earbuds included. The most obvious con to me is the speed, which is just OK. This is why I docked a star, although for the price this is as much as you can expect.This phone runs a close to pure version of android 5.02. When you first power on the phone, it prompts you to download a software update that takes care of the stagefright vulnerability.If you are on T-Mobile, this phone has band 12.Although the phone lets you uninstall some apps, one app that can't be uninstalled and can't be disabled is the music player. I like to use another music player app and I have to be careful that I don't turn the factory one on by mistake, or else I'll have 2 different songs playing at the same time.I've noticed that if I'm holding the phone upside down (ie, if I'm reading lying down) when I click the screen, it might not take. But if I'm just holding the phone in my hand with the screen facing up (which is the normal way) then it works every time.All in all, I have only minor nits to pick and I think this to be an all around solid phone. Even if you don't buy this phone, don't automatically buy a phone from a carrier....shop around and you can find more for your money.","243","Alcatel","2"

Its not the music app, because I checked it, it wasn't playing anything, then I closed it and all other open apps and the music continued. It must have been streaming since I didn't have that music, yet it was a completely different genre from the last playlist I streamed. Often when I unlock my phone and start doing stuff the music stops, but not always.Still an OK phone if you have no money.

"623","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","292.98","3","Received firmware updates since I bought it, making it much MUCH better than when it first arrived, IMO. But the weird thing is sometimes I pull it out of my pocket and it's jus a black screen. No matter how many times I hit the power button it won't wake up or turn on - I have to hold the power button for 10 seconds to reset it. This has happened through multiple firmware versions. Also, the auto-brightness has a tendency to stay bright and melt my eyes at night.The screen quality is nice, but over time I'm starting to be able to see something behind the screen - not sure if they're individual LEDs or if they're related to the digitizer / touch sensor or what, they look like small rings (although I will admit this phone has already taken a beating and I don't protect it with a case since it was an inexpensive device).Overall, though, the speed and responsiveness are nice. It's not the best device I've ever owned, but for the price I paid, I'm not too unhappy The speakers are fairly impressive, and they can get nice and loud on their own. In the end, it's VERY light and thin and that is impressive, but there are probably more impressive phones available for less money if you want something that was a flagship a few years ago. The downside to those is, you might not end up with Marshmallow, like this phone has been upgraded to.6.0.1. If you leave it at the stock 5.x that it came with, you're probably going to be very disappointed in this phone - I know I wasn't impressed with it at all until the firmware update arrived.","243","Alcatel","2"

We spent quite a bit of time researching all of the options available both above and below this price range, and this phone looked to be a great value, and it really is. We are very pleased with our purchase. We use it with T-Mobile on one of their pre-paid plans and have had a very good experience with the phone and T-Mobile. We are also going to be traveling outside the country, and this phone comes unlocked and supports all of the bands that we need.Pros: The screen looks great, and is very bright and crisp. The camera takes very nice pictures and video. The phone fits nicely in the hand and looks and feels like a much more expensive phone. The build quality is excellent. We charge them after a couple days of normal use, so the battery seems to last a respectable amount of time. The sound, as other reviewers have mentioned, is just excellent. This thing can really put out some sound, and gone are the days of not being able to hear your phone ring! Playing music on it sounds great, and is stereo (one speaker at each end of the phone). The phone is reversible, with a microphone and speaker at each end, so it doesn't matter which way its facing when you pick it up to answer it, the phone will just take care of it based on the orientation using the gyro sensor. This isn't really a must have feature, but it is kind of nice. It plays videos (such as YouTube) very well, and it feels very smooth and responsive in every app we've tried. The value for the money is great, and we would still be very happy with it if we paid more.Cons:Wish it supported dual sim cards instead of just one, but you get a microSD card spot instead, so not too bad and most people probably only need one sim card slot anyway.Wish the volume could be adjusted in smaller increments, but this isn't the phone's fault, it's an android thing and not a deal breaker at all.In closing, we are very pleased with our purchase of two of these phones and would quickly and happily buy them again. If you are looking for a great unlocked GSM phone and don't want to pay an arm and a leg, then give this one a try. We highly recommend it!","243","Alcatel","2"

"638","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","292.98","5","This seems to be a great little phone.When I saw it would cost $700 to get a new Samsung to replace my old S3, I shopped around. I bought the Alcatel Idol 3 (4.7"") from Amazon and after a week am pretty much thrilled at how well it works.The setup had some bumps for me because my cloud files were not up to date. My advice here is to update your contacts, files (including downloads), and pictures before cluttering the new phone with junk So don't log in to your Google acount (yes, even just for email) until stuff is updated and synch'ed up on the old phone.Also, perhaps because the Alcatel phone is ""unlocked"" and is not a service provider's proprietary device, it does not wake up in your hand knowing how to handle internet data. When you enter an in-range WiFi password, the Internet will work fine. To get it to work when you do NOT have WiFi, you will need to setup the mobile networks. This might be as easy as selecting your; provider in settings:(wireless networks - more - mobile networks - access point names - and then either select yourprovider.) You might need to enter the info manually if your provider is not listed. I found listings online by searching for ""AT&T Alcatel APN settings"" but didn't need it because my carrier is AT&T and there was a preconfigured choice as I described earlier.The ""unlocked"" feature is great because it means the phone works with SIM chips from any provider. So if I switch from AT&T to Verizon, Sprint, or any other service provider, this phone will work instantly as soon as I insert the chip. Also, if I travel to a foreign country -- in addition to being able to function on multiple networks --, I will be able to buy a chip for any country and put it into my own phone. If you have travelled, you know what I am talking about. Using your own phone is wonderful in foreign countries.NOTE: My phone accepted a memory chip in addition to the SIM; I see you CAN get a dual SIM option; which I do not understand. The little chip carrier can removed by pushing a paper clip into the tiny hole on the left side of the phone. The little tray slides all the way out. The chips do not fit snugly, but must be sort of balanced or set carefully and then inserted gently. I was actually surprised when it worked because the whole process seemed to require more faith than skill. The phone is so small and compact, it is easy to forgive this space saving compromise.I haven't compared the camera, but it seems fine. I got accustomed to popping the back off my Samsung and just dropping in a newly charged battery, but the Alcatel is sealed. I guess if the battery dies I will need to send it in for service or just replace the whole thing.In general, I think there are enough good reasons to give this phone a try and it is a low risk. Alcatel also makes a 5.5"" phone, so if you want a bigger unit, it's an option.I know this sounds almost evangelical, but I do pay attention to details.

This is coming from someone who was using one of the largest phablets around in the Sony Xperia Z Ultra.It offers a nice compact clean design asthetic, great dual front facing speakers and a lil touch of customization (mainly icons and a few apps) on top of stock Android 5.0.2 as of writing this review.The processing package had me concerned at first but once you actually use the device and tailor it your liking, you realize how snappy and responsive it really is. My only complaint is that Alcatel didn't go all out and create enough accessories for this phone, it's kinda difficult to find a decent case for it but I enjoy the design language so much that I'm willing to just go 'naked' with this one.In conclusion, I'm very happy with my purchase and may consider buying the 5.5 inch sibling down the road.","243","Alcatel","2"

As someone who has had many many phone (roughly 5-6 a year) I know what I like. I'm sick of the huge screens so this footprint is perfect for me. This by no means is a flag ship device and shouldn't be treated as such , but it has a very crisp screen , a good camera , wonderful front facing speakers and is was $180 bucks and on prime I got 1 day free shipping. I have the 2gb moto g model and I will be leaving my collection because of this phone. If you not a power user this phone is great , it does everything you want it too and I've averaged about 5.5 hours of SOT on wifi. So buy with confidence.","243","Alcatel","2"
"646","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","292.98","5","Excellent budget android phone. I have been unhappy with my previous phone for some time. I felt like finding the right phone at a decent price was impossible. I wanted 4g LTE, unlocked gsm, 16gb internal with an expandable storage SD slot, and it needed to be 4.7"" or less to comfortably fit in my hands and my wallet. I found a few compact phones that would work, but they would cost upwords of $200 used. This phone fit the criteria. I know decreasing its size downgraded some of the specs from the 5.5"" version, but I am a simple smartphone user and don't need a top of the line phone. This phone is lighter and has better specs than my old phone, so I am happy!","243","Alcatel","2"

Otherwise, it's been a pretty good phone. One other potential issue is that the phone doesn't really integrate very well with expandable memory, but this is hardly an Android issue exclusive to the OneTouch.","243","Alcatel","2"
"648","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","292.98","5","I am very happy that I purchased this phone. I switched from a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 because it was outdated and just too big! I was sick of it. So I went out to T-Mobile to upgrade to a new phone but I couldn't find one that was significantly smaller than the Note 2 (5.7"" screen). They just do not make normal sized phones anymore. That is where the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 4.7"" comes into play. It is the PERFECT SIZE. The only thing big about this phone is the name! Good specs for somebody who just needs a phone for normal use. Yes, it is not the fastest phone out there but for the money, you CAN'T beat it! To be honest, it is very snappy to me and the screen quality is great. Not to mention, the 13MP camera is extremely fast and takes good quality pics.I highly recommend this phone!Also note, in my experience, the Amazon free shipping was extremely slow! I would upgrade to the next available shipping method if you want your phone in less than a week.","243","Alcatel","2"
"649","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","292.98","2","I purchased the 4.7 version after having the 5.5 for 2wks. I wanted to see if the smaller version would be the larger version in smaller packaging. I was a bit disappointed because battery life is my most important feature in any device. The screen was also not as stunning as the larger. For the price it's a decent phone but I was not purely impressed. I still have the 5.5 version and have very little negative remarks. It's definitely large which is the only thing I don't like. I wouldn't recommend the 4.7 version over other budget phones.","243","Alcatel","2"
"650","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","292.98","5","My day to day phone is a Samsung Note 4, so I wanted a smaller phone for times when the Samsung is just too large. I've only had the Idol for a day, but for most people who don't do serious gaming on a cell, it's a great bargain. It's very light, the software is basically stock Android so it's quite snappy, and the screen is satisfactory. Battery life seems to be ok, with enough power to last a whole day and charging is quite quick. The only real negatives I see is that the SIM/MicroSD card tray is a pain to use (which will only be an issue for those who swap phones a lot) and Wifi is 2.4 only (not 5). No, there is no way that this can be compared with a high end phone, but for the price it will do everything that probably 98% of phone users need. It will be interesting to see how many peopple keep buying $700 high-end phones now that American cell phone companies aren't playing the subsidy game anymore and people realize how much their free or $199 phone really costs.","243","Alcatel","2"
"651","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","292.98","5","Though it's only been 24 hours, I am super impressed by the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 4.7 inch smartphone (name is terrible though). This is a great time for affordable, mid-range, unlocked, no-contract smartphones. This phone slots in between the two models of the 3rd generation Moto G. Other than the RAM (1.5 GB vs 2 GB), it's very similar in specs to the more expensive Moto G model but at the price of the less expensive Moto G model (for now). I bought the Alcatel instead of the Moto G because it has a smaller, sleeker design (4.7 inch vs 5.0 inch screen and half as thin) and terrific front-facing stereo speakers. The screen is sharp and the speakers are very loud! The Idol 4.7 looks similar to the old Google Nexus 4, which I owned, but slimmer and sleeker (and more plasticy). It's a little smaller than an iPhone 6 despite having the same screen size, and about as thin. The Moto G has much more durable build and is waterproof, and I suspect, better support. Both the Alcatel and the Moto G make great backup or travel phones, and also starter smartphones for teens. They can also be very solid everyday phones for most consumers. As the wireless companies move away from contracts and subsidizing phones, I wonder whether more folks will start moving to some of the mid-range phones. Many folks have been paying $600-800 every two years for new phones without really knowing it. Perhaps Apple will be safe with its high-end clientele--at least for now--but companies like Samsung are very vulnerable. These $200 phones are more than good enough for the typical user--with performance comparable to the flagship phones from two years ago. I worry a bit about durability given the materials it's made out of. I should probably buy a case, but the phone is so sleek and attractive that I kind of don't want to put one on. Five stars for the amazing value! The Quality to price ratio for this phone is terrific.","243","Alcatel","2"
"652","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","292.98","5","This phone has blown away my expectations. In a world full of phablets and cell phones that seem to just be getting larger and larger (and more and more expensive as well), it's becoming seemingly harder and harder to find a small phone that will actually perform. This phone does just that, and does it well.Initially I had owned an LG G4. I thought about it and realized, man this is insane that I am spending $600+ on a cell phone. I decided to return the LG G4 and give the Alcatel Idol 3 5.5 a try. While I loved the phone, it was still larger than I was hoping, and the 4.7 had not yet been released. Then one day I checked Amazon, and the 4.7 was out, so I made the exchange (and I couldn't be happier).People may complain about the specs when compared to some current flagship phones. Are they as good? No. But here's the thing, just a year and a half ago or so, if you saw the specs on this phone, they would have blown you away. Think about the flagship phones from a year or two ago. Were they bad, slow, etc? No, they were top of the line. This phone has the same specs, if not better, that those phones had. That being said, I have not experienced a single hiccup with this phone yet. No lag when switching screens or apps, no delay in taking pictures, no freezing or apps crashing. So ask yourself, do I really NEED a phone with specs that the $600-900 phones are offering?Pros:Screen - It's beautiful. Is it 1080P? No, and it doesn't need to be. At 4.7"" 720P is gorgeous, and looks just as nice as my LG G4 did. Know what is awesome about the screen being 720P? Battery life. The ""lower"" resolution will greatly improve battery life.Sound - The JBL front facing stereo speakers are magnificent. The sound is very loud, and very clear. Watching music videos, listening to music, and even the alarm are all very impressive with the volume and clarity. The JBL headphones that come with the phone also have excellent sound and come with different size earbuds to ensure a good fit.Speed - It's fast. There's no lag when switching apps, browsing the web, multitasking, sending emails, etc. One review I read elsewhere of the phone stated that when typing, the phone would sometimes lag and have to ""catch up"" to his typing. I am a very fast typer, and I have yet to experience this, so YMMV.Size - Perfect. Everything can be done with one hand. It fits well in your palm. Very thin.Camera - 13MP rear, and 5MP front. Both take excellent photos. Most importantly to me, they both take photos QUICKLY. I have a one year old, and having to wait 2-3 seconds after pressing the capture button will often times make me miss the shot, or have them end up blurry. The Idol 3 takes it almost instantly 95% of the time.Battery Life - Very impressed. Having the ""slower"" processor, and the ""lower resolution"" screen, both help to improve the battery life greatly. I have been using the phone pretty much non stop since getting it. I am a heavy texter, social media user, and I use the music player with both a bluetooth speaker and a bluetooth stereo headset for 2+ hours a day. I have been setting the phone up and redownloading all the apps on my previous phones, so I have been on it constantly. End of the day it still has plenty of charge left to it. I imagine the average user will have no problem getting through a day, and a heavy user may be able to as well.Cost - Can't be beat, obviously. $179 for this phone is an absolute steal.Cons:Brand - Not because Alcatel is bad, but because it isn't popular. This means little 3rd party support for accessories and whatnot. Currently the only tempered glass screen protector available on Amazon is by Mr. Shield, and the fitment is very poor. There are not a lot of cases available at this time. Hopefully this will change as more people realize what a gem this phone is and actually start buying it.Overall, this phone is amazing and well worth your money. I can't imagine what you would be doing that requires a phone that costs $600 more than this phone, honestly. The size is perfect, it's fast, the sound is incredible, and the battery life has been awesome. Alcatel has a real winner in this phone. The only competition I see at this price point would be the new Moto G, however I love the form factor and design of the Alcatel.","243","Alcatel","2"

Hence this review deserves atleast 1 star.I heard about this model in Feb 2015 when it was announced in CES. I was very much interested just because of form factor (I am not a fan of 5+"" and hefty phones). Was waiting to buy since then.. I think it was released in UK region in June then in US in September. Considering 5.5"" phone was priced at $199 for initial launch, I was hoping 4.7"" will be priced at $150 but it didnot. But I bought at for 180+ tax anyway.1) Though it was good initial days, battery drain (10% in 10 mins during non-usage of phone) and constant reboot (especially using camera) made me to return and get second phone.2) Second phone did not turn on et all. Did a factory reset and was able to turn on. Worked fine for 3-4 days and alas again same problem as above. Could not resist to return it back. Amazon is good in this process and hence I would buy from Amazon knowing my purchases are protected.For some days in October, this product was not available. There was notice ""there is some problem in inventory.. we will let you know when resolved"".. Not sure I got two defective items. I did noticed few good feedback on this phone here but somehow both phones didnt work for me. Good buy Alcatel.","243","Alcatel","2"

I didn't like the 5.5 due to it's size and had been thinking about replacing it, but couldn't justify buying another phone for no reason. I always found the 5.5 a bit too large for my hands and for my pockets.The 4.7 is perfect for my hands but is slightly slower than the 5.5. The slowdown is barely noticeable, this phone also doesn't have a release yet for the latest version of android, however it works perfectly out of the box for everything I do. This phone has no bloatware other than an antivirus program and a couple of other small apps that are easily removed. It's about as pure of an android experience as you'll get out of the box. For the price, build quality and general ease of use, I highly recommend this for anyone who isn't into iphones.","243","Alcatel","2"

It has a very nice, vivid, bright display, and the JBL speakers are good and loud. It has decent battery life, especially if you just watch an occasional YouTube video. 4G LTE works well, and its fast on wifi too. I get hi fps on Riptide GP 2 on high settings, and most other games and 360 video work well. If you really want an immersive experience with a small price tag, this is the phone I would recommend.

Love the volume key as the camera shutter, it makes taking multiple shots so much easier and convenient. Camera can even be activated when screen is locked without unlocking the phone. Finally, I love the eye unlock but it is difficult using this feature at night or with insufficient light, which is complemented by another option (I.e pin code). Tried to lock phone many times by turning it over but never seemed to get this right, will try again though. Did not have much time to experiment with all the features of the phone before loosing it, but will surely spend more time with the next one.

I did a lot (A LOT) of research over a few months, and landed on this model because of price, ram, reviews, and the availability of being on tmobile band 12.Since this is my first phone I don't have anything to compare it to, but I do love it, can't go back to a basic now. I've had it just approaching 2 months and no complaints with the software or usability. The call quality isn't so great, but it could be just that I work in an area that maybe have bad reception, and getting the sim card in was such a chore, the card kept falling out while trying to slide it back in - frustrating but i eventually got it in. The camera is fine, the display is great, the sound! my god the sound blew me away. Overall you can't go wrong for the price, and I bought a case with screen protector on amazon as well for $8. I highly recommend if you're looking for a phone with not much bloatware, enough ram and easy usability.","243","Alcatel","2"

"692","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","292.98","5","I rarely write reviews but I believe I will be doing a greater good if I share my experience. I have had Iphone 4s, and Iphone 5s in the past. The reason I had iPhone in the past was its reliability and battery life. However, I had to switch to another phone when I broke my iPhone (I did not want to pay a premium price to get another phone) and was looking for an option with the best value for money.Alcatel one touch idol 3 4.7"" is a hidden gem. So far, I am EXTREMELY happy with the phone. The image quality is superb even though it has 720p screen resolution. I did not find any difference with iPhone or any higher resolution phone. In fact its the vibrant screen makes it so much more appealing than the rather neutral iPhone. Next, the sound quality of the speakers. Just Wow! Can't believe this phone has incredible speakers. Love watching netflix, youtube or listening to music in my phone. My wife cannot figure out if the sound is coming from the cell phone or the television. The next most important factor is the battery in this phone. Till now, I have observed that its life is as good as iPhone. This phone has more juice left towards the end of the day than an iPhone. I am surprised but thats the fact. Though the phone drains more battery when the navigation App is used, but again I won't complain about it. The Apps start and run very fine. There had been some occasion, when the app may not fire up. In that case, I would just free up the memory and it would work fine. This is hardly a concern.Another best feature of this phone is the form factor. The phone is so thin, that it immediately draws attention. Besides being thin, it very light and I do not feel it in my pocket. 4.7"" is the perfect size for the phone. Its not too big and not too small. Perfect for reading, watching, chatting and other day to day activities. I love this phone!I can't believe I had been wasting my money on iPhones when I had so much better option. Android really gives you a much better option to customize with widgets. I would suggest a new user to spend sometime to personalize this phone with better wallpaper, widgets, changing the default options for apps. Then you will love it as much as I do. Go for it and I would bet you will be amazed.","243","Alcatel","2"

My wife doesn't like big phones, but doesn't want to be stuck with the typical cheap phone you have to get that has a smaller size. Calls are clear (HD calls supported on T-Mobile), screen is great quality for a phone this size, and the photos aren't too bad. Performance is way better than expected. The fact that it has 16GB of space and 1.5GB of RAM makes it really worth the money when compared to other phones in this price range (most have 8GB of space or only 1GB of RAM). The only downside for T-Mobile users is that it doesn't support Band 12, but we don't have that in our area, so it's not an issue. Very recommended for those who want a smaller but good performing phone!","243","Alcatel","2"

I bought one for my husband and for myself, but both of ours have had constant call quality issues. I dropped my cell phone which was definitely my fault, but only the corner was slightly cracked. When I woke up this morning after leaving my phone on the table overnight, the crack had spread throughout the top half of the screen and now the screen no longer works. It's $150 to replace the screen which is almost what the phone cost. This would be a great phone if not for the slow power on, the terrible call quality and the clearly terribly designed screen.

The only other complaint that I have is how the photos look when taken indoors. While this still could be user error as I have only had the phone for about a week, the colors while taken inside seem to be a bit on the yellow side and not quite as sharp as I had hoped. Outdoor photos are wonderful, however! Another issue I have with the phone is with texting. While using the speech-to-text, if I need to correct an error, the very last word I say is repeated when I attempt to erase it. Not a big deal but it bugs me that I can't figure out why it does this.

"725","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","292.98","2","Received in box: Phone, sim tray tool, charger w/ cord, JBL in-ear headphones w/ variety of tips, and multi-language manual.Let me start this review by stating that I've had cell phones for nearly 20 years. I always tend to go ""middle of the road"" with my phone models, keep them 1-2 years, then get a new one. No flagships, but no junk, either. I've had LG, Samsung, Moto, etc. Most of the big players in the American market. I've never had an iPhone. I mention this to give a frame of reference on how my experience with cell phones was formed.When I was shopping for a phone, I just happened across this one. I had heard of Alcatel before, but never really considered any of their phones. The reviews of this particular model all seemed favorable, and at this price-point it seemed like a really solid choice. I won't re-hash the basic specs that you can read all over the internet, but I'll touch on some things that I've noted and liked/disliked:First impression of the phone: It has a very nice look about it. It's very thin and very light in the hand. The whole face of the unit is glass, and the sides are chromed plastic that give a pretty high-quality look, overall. No complaints.The phone comes with a surprisingly nice set of JBL in-ear headphones with mic and controller. I don't personally like this style of earbuds, but I did try them out and was definitely pleased with the sound quality of music, videos, and phone calls.After inserting my sim and SD cards, and charging up for a bit, I turned on the unit. It walked me through a pretty standard set-up routine, then I let it update Android, and put my usual apps on it. After a bit of personalization and sorting out un-used apps, this thing was ready to go. All the while, I noticed how nice the screen was and how apps popped open quickly, and just the overall positive impression the phone gave me.My observations:-To me the most important thing with a cell phone is... its ability to function like a phone. It seems weird to feel the need to state this, but I bet a lot of people rarely actually call people and talk to them w/ their cell phones. I have T-Mobile, and while I generally don't have reception issues, my neighborhood actually seems to be pretty spotty and my last phone would often drop calls in certain sections of my neighborhood. In my house, I would often have to use my wi-fi to make calls. The Alcatel works better than any other phone I've tried. It never dropped calls, crystal clear reception and people that I've talked to said it sounded like my calls were as clear as a landline.-The speakers on the Alcatel are really quite good, considering the size. Music sounds really nice on the speakers, and the output to headphones is above average. I like that there are 2 speakers, one at either end of the phone. Gives a bit of stereo effect if you're watching a video.-The picture quality of the screen is quite nicer than I expected. Colors are good, images seem decently sharp. Not as nice as a Galaxy, or iPhone, but... look at the price difference. I watched a bunch of Netflix, Youtube, etc. and I was really impressed overall.-I found the size of the unit to be almost perfect for me. I actually am a very tall guy, big hands, etc. and you would think that I'd like a bigger phone, but honestly, I like to be able to put the phone in my pocket, or be able to access all of the functions with one hand. Overall, it's just convenient for me to have this size. I really wish that phone manufacturers would settle down with making ever-larger phones and make some quality ones in this size.-The battery life is very good. I am not exactly a ""heavy user"" but I do make calls, check emails, check Twitter, and watch the occasional vid. I don't really do games, aside from the occasional solitaire. I leave the wifi and GPS on 24/7. I easily got over a day before needing to charge. If I had particularly light usage during a day and didn't watch any video, I could go nearly 40 hours before needing to plug-in.-I am not any kind of expert on Android's different iterations. I don't tweak my phones, or run different ROMS or anything like that. I can say that this phone's OS/ skin/ whatever didn't bug me. It just worked. No complaints. Seemed like standard Android fare that I'm used to, and nothing raised any flags for me. Just a decent system with things doing what I expected them to do.-The cameras, both front and back, are pretty good, I think. I take a lot of pictures for work and hobbies, but not for ""portraits"" or anything like that, more record-keeping. My requirements are pretty low. I can say that with good lighting, the rear camera took very nice pictures. If you're used to phones in this price range, the cameras are going to seem pretty normal. Nothing bad to report, just a solid camera.As for what I didn't like about the phone:-This is very subjective, and not really a big deal (actually it's bordering on silly of me, if I'm being honest): the power button was on the left side andthe volume rocker was on the right. This is opposite of every other phone I've had. I was constantly turning the phone off when I had been intending to change the volume. As I said, not a big deal, but just something I thought I'd mention.**AND NOW FOR WHY I RATED THIS 2 STARS:**-The astute reader will note that most of this is written in the past tense. I have returned the phone. As much as I like nearly everything about this phone, I experienced a deal-breaking problem with two of these.My first phone had a stuck pixel in the lower right section of the screen. When viewing lighter colors on the screen, it wasn't terribly noticeable. But when viewing darker materials or movies, or whatever, it really stuck out. I guess I'm pretty lucky in that I've never had a phone with any kind of problems, but I'm realistic. I know problems slip through the cracks sometimes. I just figured it was ""my turn"" to get a bad one. No big deal. Thank goodness for Amazon Prime, right? So I sent it back, and ordered another one. After a day or two of using the new phone, I noticed that the screen had a problem in roughly the same area as the other one, though it was a different problem. Lower right hand side of the screen. When running my finger across the screen, I'd get a distortion in that spot like when you press a flatscreen too hard. I wasn't pressing too hard, though. No different than any other area of the screen. While this defect was much less bothersome than the stuck pixel, it was still a problem, and I figured it would only get worse with time. So, back it went while it was still under the return period for Amazon.So, overall, I cannot recommend this particular phone. I really wanted to like it, but the fact that it had a screen problem on two of them in the same spot kind of spooked me off of it. I will keep my eye on the Alcatel Idol series and may try it again someday, as I really was impressed with so many aspects of this phone.","243","Alcatel","2"

Everything has made me happy so far. Sound Quality: the sound is amazing for a cell phone and perhaps its most bright quality. There are dual front speakers which produce LOUD, crystal clear music. You wouldn't think a phone could have the capability to have professional sound. Out of all the phones I've tested, this phone wins first place award for sound.Battery Charge: The battery is decent. I use the phone heavily and charge the phone about once a night, which is reasonable. Of course, if you're browsing the web and watching videos, the battery drains very quickly. But if you're listening to Spotify or something and put the phone on lock, the battery would last a much longer time. With light use, I've gone 2-3 days without charging the phone.Storage: 16GB is great. I've downloaded 10+ apps with ease, not to mention my picture Gallery which probably contains thousands of photos and a music library with maybe 200 songs. Most phones at this price contain a lower amount of storage.Durability: Unfortunately, this phone's glass is much more fragile since it does NOT use Gorilla Glass like many smartphones. I've had a few average drops which caused my tempered glass screen protector to crack. If you buy this phone, you MUST have a tempered glass screen protector.Overall, I love this phone and believe I will keep it for a long time. I highly recommend you purchase it. It's definitely worth paying more than $180 for! It has lots of storage, awesome sound, a very attractive & sleek design, good enough battery, and more.","243","Alcatel","2"

I wanted something smaller and this 4.7"" IDOL 3 is perfect for me. The only downside is the new firmware installed on it which locked the boot-loader. I was hoping to flash a custom ROM on it, but so far unsuccessful. Can get root access to remove apps that are useless to me, but not many of those anyway. Very simple launcher interface with limited customization features Alcatel (TCL) gives us. Custom launcher is the answer to that (i'm using MIUI which I like personally, it gives me more customization options and its free). I would actually go with Huawei P8 Light instead (MIUI, design, and hardware) but it's missing this one Band frequency that i need to use overseas sometimes. P8 Light is my first choice for the phone under $200 to use in the States, but IDOL 3 is truly Global. That's the only reason it's not P8 light on the other end of the line of whoever is talking to me :) I'm happy either way. My money spent well.","243","Alcatel","2"

"745","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","292.98","5","Iv'e had the phone for around a week now and just love it. From the form factor to the amazing front firing speakers to the intuitive stock android lollipop interface. I am using it on cricket wireless and everything just worked right away once i popped my sim card in. Wifi and LTE reception are on par or possibly superior to the LG G2 i replaced. Battery life on standby isnt quite as good as my G2, but while actually using the phone (watching videos especially) it mops the floor of the G2 in terms on on screen time. This is due to the lower res (but still very nice) screen and lower power snapdragon 410 CPU. Dont let the lower power fool you, ive yet to run into any scenario the phone hasnt performed just as well as my G2, which on paper is twice as fast. Just a heads up to buyers of the 5.5"" model (too big for my tastes, but seems to be the preferred size nowadays) is that it is coming to cricket wireless nov 6th for 149.00 bucks, 100 bucks off retail. Mind you it wont be unlocked, this would just be for people using cricket, and as a cricket customer i have only good things to say about them (they use ATT towers, they are the best MNVO by miles).The only con i can come up with on the phone is that it does not beep at you when fully charged, but the LED light goes off after its been at 100% for a couple minutes. I remedied this with an app called Gsam for the app store, now my phone beeps when it hits 100% :)In my opinion this blows away the competition (looking at you moto g) for the money, 16gb storage and 1.5gb memory really put it head and shoulders above other phones in this price range. Not to mention the better screen, absurdly loud speakers and overall dainty form factor (for a phone in 2015).Trust me, you will not regret this purchase, especially if you are looking for a phone under the ""norm"" 5""+ form factor.","243","Alcatel","2"

It's a breath of fresh air from all these phablets and near phablets. I guess I'm in a minority for wanting a smaller phone. Battery life is great and performance is really good. I can't see any lags navigating through menus. I don't play games on my phone so I'm not sure how good the graphics processor. It has outstanding standby time. The screen is great even under sun light. The phone is very light and it produces incredible sound from its dual stereo front facing speakers. The screen is very crisp despite not being 1080P (not a knock, anything below 5"" screen doesn't need a 1080P screen). I've had the 5.5"" version but found it a bit too big for my taste. This phone is perfect, it's even a tad bit smaller than an iPhone 6/6S. 16GB is fine paired up with my 64GB Sandisk memory card. I didn't even think about the Moto G 2015 because with 16GB it's already close to the Idol 3 5.5"" ~$250 price. I'm not so worried about updates. As long as there are security patches and the apps work, then it's fine.","243","Alcatel","2"

"763","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","292.98","5","We bought two of these phones (at full price, so this is an actual customer review, not one that may be biased by having received it for free or at a discount) a few months ago and still really love them. We spent quite a bit of time researching all of the options available both above and below this price range, and this phone looked to be a great value, and it really is. We are very pleased with our purchase. We use it with T-Mobile on one of their pre-paid plans and have had a very good experience with the phone and T-Mobile. We are also going to be traveling outside the country, and this phone comes unlocked and supports all of the bands that we need.Pros: The screen looks great, and is very bright and crisp. The camera takes very nice pictures and video. The phone fits nicely in the hand and looks and feels like a much more expensive phone. The build quality is excellent. We charge them after a couple days of normal use, so the battery seems to last a respectable amount of time. The sound, as other reviewers have mentioned, is just excellent. This thing can really put out some sound, and gone are the days of not being able to hear your phone ring! Playing music on it sounds great, and is stereo (one speaker at each end of the phone). The phone is reversible, with a microphone and speaker at each end, so it doesn't matter which way its facing when you pick it up to answer it, the phone will just take care of it based on the orientation using the gyro sensor. This isn't really a must have feature, but it is kind of nice. It plays videos (such as YouTube) very well, and it feels very smooth and responsive in every app we've tried. The value for the money is great, and we would still be very happy with it if we paid more.Cons:Wish it supported dual sim cards instead of just one, but you get a microSD card spot instead, so not too bad and most people probably only need one sim card slot anyway.Wish the volume could be adjusted in smaller increments, but this isn't the phone's fault, it's an android thing and not a deal breaker at all.In closing, we are very pleased with our purchase of two of these phones and would quickly and happily buy them again. If you are looking for a great unlocked GSM phone and don't want to pay an arm and a leg, then give this one a try. We highly recommend it!","243","Alcatel","2"

"768","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","292.98","5","This seems to be a great little phone.When I saw it would cost $700 to get a new Samsung to replace my old S3, I shopped around. I bought the Alcatel Idol 3 (4.7"") from Amazon and after a week am pretty much thrilled at how well it works.The setup had some bumps for me because my cloud files were not up to date. My advice here is to update your contacts, files (including downloads), and pictures before cluttering the new phone with junk So don't log in to your Google acount (yes, even just for email) until stuff is updated and synch'ed up on the old phone.Also, perhaps because the Alcatel phone is ""unlocked"" and is not a service provider's proprietary device, it does not wake up in your hand knowing how to handle internet data. When you enter an in-range WiFi password, the Internet will work fine. To get it to work when you do NOT have WiFi, you will need to setup the mobile networks. This might be as easy as selecting your; provider in settings:(wireless networks - more - mobile networks - access point names - and then either select yourprovider.) You might need to enter the info manually if your provider is not listed. I found listings online by searching for ""AT&T Alcatel APN settings"" but didn't need it because my carrier is AT&T and there was a preconfigured choice as I described earlier.The ""unlocked"" feature is great because it means the phone works with SIM chips from any provider. So if I switch from AT&T to Verizon, Sprint, or any other service provider, this phone will work instantly as soon as I insert the chip. Also, if I travel to a foreign country -- in addition to being able to function on multiple networks --, I will be able to buy a chip for any country and put it into my own phone. If you have travelled, you know what I am talking about. Using your own phone is wonderful in foreign countries.NOTE: My phone accepted a memory chip in addition to the SIM; I see you CAN get a dual SIM option; which I do not understand. The little chip carrier can removed by pushing a paper clip into the tiny hole on the left side of the phone. The little tray slides all the way out. The chips do not fit snugly, but must be sort of balanced or set carefully and then inserted gently. I was actually surprised when it worked because the whole process seemed to require more faith than skill. The phone is so small and compact, it is easy to forgive this space saving compromise.I haven't compared the camera, but it seems fine. I got accustomed to popping the back off my Samsung and just dropping in a newly charged battery, but the Alcatel is sealed. I guess if the battery dies I will need to send it in for service or just replace the whole thing.In general, I think there are enough good reasons to give this phone a try and it is a low risk. Alcatel also makes a 5.5"" phone, so if you want a bigger unit, it's an option.I know this sounds almost evangelical, but I do pay attention to details. Seems like a winner to me.","243","Alcatel","2"

The UI lags severely even with hardly any apps running.Pros: - Screen. Very bright and colorful 1080p display. - Speakers. JBL audio working great. Plenty loud - MicroSD. Great to have. Allows apps natively installed to the card. Great feature with only 16 GB on board. - LTE. Grabbed LTE on ATT no problem.Cons - LAG. SOOO BAD! sent it back within a few hours of getting it. The Zenfone 2 blows it away in this category. - No fast charging. This might be able to be overlooked, but after having a Nexus 6 and the Zenfone, you get spoiled by it.Overall if you can deal with the lag and sluggishness, it's a great phone. I don't game on my phone as I have a tablet, which is why I tried this phone thinking it can do daily tasks fine but the UI lagging just got to me. I think the culprit is it only being clocked at 1.5 ghz, even the lower end zenfone @ $199 is 1.8 ghz. for $50 more, go with the Zenfone 2 with 4gb of ram and 64gb on board. Yea, the speaker sucks on the Zen, but the display is still pretty good and it runs so much better.","907","Alcatel","2"

I suppose it's major draw is it's relative affordability compared to the Big Brand Name smartphones?CONS:I've been looking for WEEKS to find a complete User Manual because the manufacturer DOESN'T HAVE ONE. It seems that there are a lot of things/features/functions not covered in the Quick Start Guide.The battery life is unimpressive; my 3-and-a-half year old Samsung Note (the original, first generation Note) has the same battery life as this.Why the heck is the Ringtone/notification so FREAKING LOUD even at the lowest setting?!Why can you NEVER turn-off the vibrate/buzz regardless of turning it off in all the settings that give you the option of turning it off? You can either have the lowest (but pretty darn loud) volume set for ringing and notifications, or vibrate/buzz. There is no ""silent"". Silent = buzz.Even with the option of the LED Notification light, which is meant to preclude the use of buzz.PROS:Yes, the display/screen quality and resolution are very nice.The overall quality of the manufacturing is excellent and exactly like any of the Big Name Brand expensive phones (you cannot tell that it is a ""low-priced"" phone at all, it looks and feels great).I prefer big phones/phablets and find this phone is a nice size.I cannot comment on the JBL/Harmon sound; I have heard only ringtones and notification tones and buzzing, which seem the same quality as any modern, good-to-best-quality name brand smartphone.In fairness, some of the things I don't like I suspect are just my own fault for not learning Android 5/Lollipop completely yet - and maybe a lot of stuff I just really hate about Lollipop...But I'm comparing this to another family member's new phone that runs Lollipop and this Alcatel phone has some very weird and undesirable features/functions, and is missing some of the more desirable ones (for my uses).It could also very well be that this is simply not the right kind of Smartphone for me.I use my phones for Internet if needed when I'm not near a PC, messaging, the occasional actual phone call, and photos;never as a music player or for watching TV/movies/videos or as an eReader (that's what my massive LED HD TVs and tablets are for).","907","Alcatel","2"

"790","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","4","My first impressions for this phone is pretty good. I'm happy to see the amount of flagship phone qualities that this packs for under $300. I previously had the Samsung Galaxy S4 and I’m happy with the switch so far. I’m loving the 5.5 inch screen for browsing the web or watching videos although it’s going to take some time for me to adjust to the size of the phone. The dual facing front speakers are great, it’s much louder and clearer than the S4’s speaker. The near stock Android user interface was nice and smooth with some lag when opening up new applications. However, there are some problems that keeps this phone away from getting a 5 star rating. The power button is placed too high to operate without adjusting your hands and I thought that the double tap to power feature would help alleviate this problem but it doesn’t work most of the time when the screen is off. One more problem is the video recording quality looks low quality, during playback it’s like watching 360p or 480p videos that is scaled up to 1080p. These problems can probably be fixed with new updates, but until then I’ll leave the rating at a 4 star for now. Here are some other pros and cons.Pros:- Bright and clear display- Great dual front facing speakers- Pretty smooth user interface- Good reception (I had no issues connecting this phone with the AT&T network)- Camera takes decent pictures for the price- Slim body- Reversible screen and call featureCons:- Power button placement- Double tap power feature is unreliable at times (subject to change)- Poor quality 1080p video recording (subject to change)- Some lag when opening application- Lack of IR blaster- Non user replaceable battery- Radio feature gets terrible receptionOther note:- The phone call sound effect volume gradually gets lower when you call someone. I don’t know if this is intentional or a defective speaker. However, when the person answers their phone the volume seemed fine throughout the call.","907","Alcatel","2"

I bought 3 units of the idol 3 for me and my 2 brothers, I bought 2 of them in July 2015 and bought the third in Jan 2016.I bought them all from Amazon and had them shipped to me where I live in the Middle East.The phone was a bit laggy and had its problems, but hey you can't complain for $250! However, the lack of support was truly shameful, we were stuck in Android 5.0.2 for a really long time!Anyway that is not my problem here, my problem is that I think the idol 3 has huge manufacturing problem!Few weeks ago, my screen cracked right under the headphone jack, what made things worst is that I couldn't use the phone once the screen was cracked, because I thinks the digitizer is fused with the screen in this phone to make it thinner. I thought I somehow was the reason that the screen cracked, but guess what?! Yesterday my brother phone cracked too, In the right same spot where my phone cracked, right under the headphone jack! This can't be a coincidence! It's the exact same place, you can take a look at the images I attached to this review!so, I'm advising you to stay away from the Idol 3 and any other cheap products from Alcatel, including the Idol 4.","907","Alcatel","2"

Guess this phone is suffering from a memory leak or just can't handle typing...Another unfortunate issue is the availability of decent phone cases.

"796","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","3","I bought this phone about a year ago and was initially very happy. Since the most recent update, however, it is slow and at times will not read my SIM card. As in, I'll be in the middle of a conversation and the call drops, I look at my screen, and it says ""No SIM card installed."" The touch screen has also gotten buggy; sometimes, you have to beat it half to death to get it to engage, other times, it calls people when something inside my purse first turns it on and then brushes against the screen. Bizarre.Having said all of this, I am on TMobile, so some of these issues may be related to the recent removal of band 12 compatibility. I definitely notice a huge drop in the call quality since the most recent update, to the point that I want to throttle the thing out the window. Even with a headset (I have tried 4 different ones), people on the other end complain that they can't hear me.As to the screen being fragile, that has not been my experience. I have dropped the phone many, many times (often onto a concrete floor) and it hasn't broken, and I haven't noticed any scratching on the screen. I don't have any kind of case on it and it swims around in my purse unprotected, so there's that.I think this is probably a really good phone for the money -- if you're not on TMobile. I really enjoyed it initially and felt a little smug that I had gotten such a great phone for such a low price. I am buying something else, though, because I've lost patience with the call quality and other strange bugginess since the update.","907","Alcatel","2"

Having owned it for a while now I see 4 major shortcomings:1. Useless as an alarm clock. Completely unreliable. Sometimes goes off at the right time. Many times does not. Takes away half the functionality.2. OS will not grant many apps write permissions to the SD card. The app will ask for it, send you to a system screen, and the system screen won't show the SD card. I call support and they say it's the app's fault (these are apps downloaded tens of millions times like rocket player and ES file browser). They say, with a straight face, that I should only use the stock apps they provide. I was stunned.3. As pretty as the big screen is, it is NOT healthy for my eyes. I was hoping to read more on it. I have stopped doing that. No sub for a good screen (eg of a decent size tablet) for comfortable reading.4. Likely will be stuck on Lollipop 5.0.2 forever. Not even 5.1.1. Very disappointing.Would not recommend.Late edit: After upgrading to Android Marshmallow problems 1,2 and 4 went away. Thanks for updating, Alcatel.Now it's a nice, cheap, (slowish), big, reliable smart phone. I'm happy.Hope this phone lives to see Android N.","907","Alcatel","2"

It's has so much less lag it's like I have a new phone!Unfortunately updating to Marshmallow removed the ability to use T-Mobile Band 12 LTE (you still get LTE on other bands) which you can't change unless you Root your phone and flash the previous radio software. But I think it's 100% worth the trade off. Get this phone now! If mine breaks I think I'll get another, no joke.----------------------First off this is the most beautiful phone I've ever owned and the speakers and screen are to die for.But the processor/RAM/internal memory/software leave a lot to be desired. It's soooo slow at times, and I usually can't have more than a few apps open at once if I want it to work at all. I'm only keeping it because I love the speakers and I'm gonna be getting the IDOL 4S when it comes out because it has specs I have been wanting for 2 years.Everything I mentioned as a downside are improved in the 4S, double the internal memory, 3GB RAM, SD 652 processor which is better than the SD 808!!! And newer software of course.I just hope I can sell the idol 3 for $100 to put towards the new one.

I purchased two of these phones (The first in June 2015 from Amazon and the second one in Sep 2015 directly from Alcatel who used Amazon to fulfill the order). My Primary reason for the purchases was support for T-Mobile Band 12 and the price point. Well, for the last couple of months, the signal quality has been noticeably worse,...missing calls, texts etc. I tried to think back to what changed and I remembered an OTA update in Janurary from Alcatel. After some research, I discovered that Alcatel's Janurary OTA firmware update REMOVED support for T-Mobile band 12! They actually took away the feature that was my primary reason for purchase. No warnings, no communications. It was done secretly and now I have two phones that perform very poorly. When I contacted them their response was basically ""Screw you...too bad."" I have read they have no plans to update it and make it work.

This is a good mid-range phone. Main reason why I switched phones is because this phone supports band 2, 4, and 12 on T-Mobile's LTE network. Where as the OnePlus One only supports band 4. Although the OnePlus One's performance is better, it does have bug issues with both Cyanogen 12 (CM12), and their Oxygen OS versions of Android 5 Lollipop. Plus, people on the other end were complaining they can't hear me clearly.Pros:- Good screen quality (Bright)- Good sound quality (with JBL dual front facing speakers)- Plastic build does not feel cheap. Has nice ""brushed"" effect- Band 2, 4, and 12 support on T-Mobile's LTE Network- Battery lasts whole day- Expandable storage with MicroSD card up to 128GB- 13MP back, 8MP front camera- Reversible- Decent quality earbuds included- Good call quality, other person can hear me clearly- $249 priceCons:- Screen quality is on the bright side. It doesn't get dark enough when turned all the way down. (had to use a screen filter app to make the screen dimmer than the lowest setting)- Camera sound/mic quality is not good.- Performance issues (can lag and freeze with certain apps. Its a software issue. Alcatel has sent out an update which helped it a little, but it still has not been completely resolved. Hoping Alcatel will send out another update soon. SnapChat has noticeable performance issues. The SnapDragon 615 has enough power to handle the performance, since lower ranged phones can handle SnapChat with no issues.)- Alcatel's light skin over Android Lollipop is ok, but it would be better if they left it stock Android.","907","Alcatel","2"

"809","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","I’m not going to get into too many explicit specs on the phone because I am trying to review this from a real-world, does-it-work? perspective. I don’t care about benchmarks, I care about how I was able to use this phone in my everyday life. If you want every technical detail, you can go here.Hardware/ScreenThe Idol is a 5.5 inch phone with a 1080p IPS screen. The back of the phone has a plastic back, but not removable (so no battery swapping). There are some faux-chrome accents that go around the device and the speakers (dual-front facing, more on that later) are at the very tippy-top and bottom of the phone. The phone feels pretty nice in the hand and wasn’t hard to hold.The screen is fantastic and one of the best features of the phone. Alcatel uses some buzz-words to describe it (TECHNICOLOR!) but the simplest way to put it is that the screen is vivid, bright and crystal clear. It’s not flagship level for 2015, that would require a QHD screen, but what it lacks in resolution vs. something like the LG G4 or Samsung Galaxy S6, it makes up for by being $300+ cheaper (off contract) than any other flagship device. Simply put, the Idol’s screen is so nice, it doesn’t feel like it should be on a phone so cheap.My other favorite hardware feature is the inclusion of a MircoSD slot next to the sim card slot (which are both in a tray that’s ejected from the left side of the phone). I basically can’t buy a phone without extra storage because I prefer to keep as much music downloaded to my phone as I can, to avoid streaming (either due to data restrictions or having access to it when I am in areas with poor coverage). The storage is up-gradable to 128gb, which goes on top of the 16gb the phone offers out of the gate (almost 10gb usable out of the box).Sound QualityThe quality of sound I get from a smartphone is critical to me. I’d say I place listening to music/podcasts as the number one use I have for a smartphone. My HTC One has audio tuned by Beats, which then morphed into Boomsound, but whatever you want to call it, it sounds great coming from the device or listening via headphones.I’m happy to say that the sound quality is another feature here that seems like it would come from a more expensive phone. Here, Alcatel touts sound tuned by JBL with an option to turn that sound optimization on or off under the settings. I much prefer the sound with the feature on and I’d say it easily rivaled my HTC One for sound quality both when listening from the device or with headphones.There’s a speaker on the top and bottom of the phone, which is, in part, necessary for their upside-down feature. Basically, you can pick up the phone for a call and it will be properly orientated regardless of it being right side up or not. I don’t find the feature to be something that was of great use to me, but I can see the function.Regardless of that feature, having two speakers on the phone is part of what makes it sound great. Some newer phones, like the Asus Zenfone 2 have what looks like dual front speakers, but in reality only one speaker is at the top or the bottom. The Idol gets LOUD when listening from the device. Louder than my One. I love this feature because it makes for listening to music or podcasts in the shower nice and easy to hear. The speakers don’t even seem to become over-burdened when at full volume.Sound quality is on par with the screen, giving the Idol 2 features that feel to be of much better quality that you’d expect from a phone in this price range.UsabilityAndroid Lollipop comes standard (I think I had 5.0 out of the gate) and is near stock. Most of the non-stock features are removable. I’ve grown to love stock Android vs. any skinned version of it, so that was a determining factor for me with the Idol.The general, day-to-day use of the Idol is perfectly adequate, but not overwhelmingly speedy. This was the first part of the phone that felt like “you get what you pay for”. That’s not to say it’s not functional, because it very much so is. Where as I found the lack of speed to be a factor in selling my Moto G, I had no such thoughts with the Idol.There are no issues with multi-tasking, I was easily able to switch between music, maps, a browser and a game. Things like that are just a bit pokey to respond. Not pokey in the sense that it takes 30 seconds of your life from you, but sometimes a program might take 1 or 2 seconds longer to open than you’d see on a phone with a top-of-the-line processor/RAM setup. Those 1 to 2 seconds seem annoying sometimes, but that just speaks to me and my lack of patience. The reality is that this phone works perfectly well and should for the vast majority of users.Call quality is perfectly adequate, but I am probably not someone who should even speak to that. I spend, maybe, 10 minutes a week using my smartphone as an actual phone, but those 10 minutes work very well. I come across clearly as does the person on the other end. The speakerphone has the benefit of the dual speakers, just as a song or podcast does.I feel like the hardware buttons would have been nicer if placed a littler lower. Due to the phone’s size, I had issues with pressing the unlock button with one hand. Not massive issues, since I’ve almost always used two hands with my phone, but for people who like a one hand device, this might not be it (if I’m being honest, I think this is a stupid reason to or not to buy a phone, I tend to just adapt to whatever device I select, but to each their own). The USB port and headphone jack are where you’d expect them, on the bottom and top, respectively.Battery LifeAnother nice feature with the phone is battery life. I don’t consider myself a super heavy user of screen time on a basic day, so I’d easily get home with 50+% after work and make it to bed with 30+% or more. Having the phone on a recent vacation where I was heavy on camera use and GPS I found myself slightly more nervous with battery life, but the phone charges very quickly (60% in 40 minutes, I think) so driving 10 minutes from one place to another, I could give a quick boost and take that nervousness away. Overall, very solid battery life for my (and I think most people’s) usage.CameraHere we get a 13MP rear-facing camera with a 8MP front-facing camera for selfies. All in all, I was very happy with the camera performance. In well lit situations, shots where clear and crisp. Some low-light situations mad for poorer quality pictures, but that’s every camera phone, ever. The biggest struggle for the camera was actually on a cloudy day. I used the camera’s time-lapse video function to film a boat trip I took on Lake Superior and you can see that the phone struggles with it’s focus and makes the land look rather dark against the cloudy sky. This could be user error, however, I’m not sure.Like every other smartphone out there, there’s an HDR function in the menu to give a little more definition to your shots. I think it worked as well as one would expect, but I stuck with the camera’s auto mode for the most part. Check out this gallery here, here and here to see some shots in all sorts of lighting conditions.Other than having the sun blare straight into the camera lens or overly dark shots, I really liked what the camera gave me. Anything I see as a negative with the camera is just the reality of using a smartphone for your main camera due to convenience. They are never going to perform like the best point-and-shoot units, but to have decent performance is nice and the Idol is a step or two above decent.Final VerdictI don’t think you can get this much phone for the money you pay, anywhere else. The Idol is, very easily, worth the extra $70 you’d be spending over a Moto G. The other phone that was hot in the running for me was the Asus Zenfone 2 (4GB Ram Version) but I picked the Idol for its superior sound quality and screen, both of which I think are better than the Asus. I know that OnePlus has their 1’s at a lower cost right now, but the lack of a Mirco SD card took them out of the running for me, I keep a lot of music on my phone.Overall, there is a trade-off between these less expensive, off-contract phones. OnePlus and Asus focused on making a very responsive, powerful phone and Alcatel focused on a better media experience. I don’t think you can go wrong with any of those three options, but the Idol Onetouch 3 was easily the phone for me….…and I miss it. As I alluded to earlier, I am back to my HTC One. I got a little to into my desire to become Ansel Adams that I may or may not have dropped the Idol in a river in Northern Wisconsin. I’d love to get another Idol, but it’s not currently in the budget and I DO have a phone that works, even if I can’t update it. I plan to wait out until next year to see what the Onetouch 4 will bring. Alcatel made a statement with this device and I hope to see them continue making phones at a budget price with specs and usability that outweigh the budget price point.","907","Alcatel","2"

I gave up on my search because I didn't get what I needed in a moderately priced android phone till I saw a friend with the 4.7 inch version of the idol 3. I browsed through and was like 'whaaat, Alcatel did this'? The phone fast, has a good camera, has good speakers and good battery life, because after about 30 minutes of watching videos, the battery didn't drain as it would've on my iPhone 6. I bought one of the 4.7 for my personal use due to its cute size and 4 of the 5.5 to sell. In my country, bigger screen phones sells faster, plus the 5.5 is the better of the two in terms of performance. It's been about a year now and none of the buyers has called to complain about anything. A special someone needs an android OS phone and the only phone that came to mind was the idol 3, my reason for buying again. We had an issue before I received the phone. I am waiting till the issue is resolved before presenting the phone.

This is my 4th Android phone over many years and by far the best yet. The screen is great, the sound is way better than any phone I've heard and the camera... it's no DSLR but hey, what do you expect for a phone? If you're expecting an iPhone 6s+ here, you may be disappointed. But for what most people use a phone for: Phone calls, check email or Facebook, look up something on the web, take a picture, it's just fine.I don't play games on this so I can't speak for the performance in that department. My guess is that you would want something a little more zippy if you're using graphics intensive apps.I have not experienced any issues with listening to audio (Pandora, PowerAmp, Google Music, Dogcatcher) or the bluetooth connection as some of the reviews may lead you to believe. I listen to music and podcasts using bluetooth to my car and a few pairs of bluetooth headsets with no stuttering or frequent dropouts. Audio quality is great over BT.The phone is updated regularly by Alcatel.Hate to say it, but sometimes things don't work out of the box. Sorry to hear that the customer service isn't great but again, you're more than welcome to spend $800 for an iPhone or Samsung if you want the best experience possible.

My Samsung's 2.1 MP front camera outperformed the Idol 3 which was very surprising.In outside lighting the camera was merely decent, but some backgrounds would be washed out. Playing with the exposure helped some, but simply not enough. I also read that perhaps you could download a different camera app that would help with the faded issue, but that really shouldn't be necessary for a 13 MP camera. Also many tech reviews about the camera were positive, so either I had a faulty device or my standards are just way too high.I was really disappointed since the phone itself was very nice and had some nice features that I didn't really get to explore.

Also I was expecting a lot from the dual speakers and have been very disappointed in the sound and loudness of them.

"877","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","4","I got this at the current price of $250, which is still a good deal for what you get. As a T-Mobile customer, I wanted a phone that supports all the T-Mobile bands (since T-mobile coverage is not all that great as it is), which is what set this apart from the Zenfone 2. I really like the phone so far.Double tap to wake has worked for me every time. Some people have reported it not working for them all the time. It works best with the launcher it came with, so if you are using some thing else like the Nova launcher, it may not work without additional tweaks. Also remember that it needs a tap, not a gentle touch, so bend your fingers when you tap.Camera seems okay so far. Some have commented about the lack of a link to Gallery. The access to Gallery is still there. It is a little different going from Android 4 to Android 5. In 5, after you take a picture, you need to swipe from right to left to review the picture you just took. If you swipe again, you can see the previous pictures you took from Gallery.I recommend using Firefox as the browser and install an add-on like adblock to make it a little easier on the phone since the CPU in this is not the top-tier workhorse the more expensive flagship phones use.","907","Alcatel","2"

"880","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","4","For the price that the phone costs you definitely get much more than you pay for, but if you can afford to spend more, then this phone is not for you. I've had pretty much most flagship phones out there.I will start with what I dislike about the phone. 1)The lag does get annoying, but then again it is exactly the same lag that I had while using Note 4. Even galaxy s6 edge has one. I have to use those cleaning apps to free up so space in order to boost the performance. I also disabled animations in the developer mode. Still after all that, the lag is there. It is noticeable during typing when it becomes slow and keys don't register right away. 2)Next thing is battery, dies pretty quick, but even though there is no quick charge, it does charge pretty fast, on park with s6 and note 4. Battery also gets hot when using the phone with having few apps open in the background. 3) Knock knock feature doesn't work most of the time.So So things.1)Display is a hit or miss type of a thing. Colors are not as vibrant as I wish they were. Colors are a bit washed out. The screen to me does not look like it comes from a flagship phone, and it's just okay, but then again it is a $250 phone, which is what I always tell myself. I wish they gave option to adjust the tone of display in this device like samsung does. 2) This phone reminds of a nexus 6 and it's radios. LTE is here, but it's not as strong. Comparing phones side by side, s6 edge gives me speeds of download 70mb and upload of 30mb, while on idol 3 I get down 20 to 40 and upload 15 to 20ish. The speeds are okay, I have no issues with that. My issue is LTE signal is not strong, and a lot of times it drops to H+.Things I really like.1) Speaker is really good. 2) Comfortable to hold this device, and slim. 3) I think cameras are great. Way much better than Note 4, but not as good as S6 edge. 4) Charges really fast. 5) Call quality is great. 6) The size of the phone, just perfect.Overall this phone does deliver things that some even top phones don't. A lot of dislikes of mine can be fixed with a software update. For the price, it is definitely worth a buy.","907","Alcatel","2"
"881","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","4","Just to be upfront I got this as a backup phone for my family to share for ""just in case"" moments. I got it on a pre-order one day sale of 199.00, and couldn't pass up a good deal like that. That being said, so far I'm pretty impressed. Doesn't have the best camera, but honestly its not really that bad at all-especially at the price I paid. I'm really appreciating the fact that the interface is simple and not cluttered. The settings menu is very easy to navigate, meaning it doesn't contain a bunch of crapware that no one uses or have an over done settings menu. Poor overall user experience, unwanted/unremovable carrier and OEM software, and overdone menus are contributing to dissatisfaction and to decline for some of the bigger manufacturers, but they just don't get it.The reversible phone screen feature's a cool little item also. Comes in handy when answering the phone and allows you to have your headphone jack facing the direction you want. The screen is surprisingly bright, crisp, and device seems very responsive and runs pretty smooth so far. It doesn't have all the power that my family's main phones have, but in real life use, it's powerful enough and seems to handle everything fairly well. Some little nitpicky things I don't like, and this is just me, and this is on ANY non pure Android phone, I don't like AM/PM showing on the lock screen- it just looks off centered. I also don't like AM/PM showing in the status bar. It's unnecessy visual clutter. Your common sense clues you in on the AM/PM status of the day and Google (Nexus) is the only one that gets that. Maybe at least an option to hide it. Don't like where the power or volume keys are placed, as I said earlier the camera is not the best, but for the most part it's actually not bad. I use Google's camera and edit it with Google Photos and the pictures come out pretty decent.Once encrypted you have no choice but to listen to the boot up sound not once- but twice. YAY! Great for when you turn your phone on in a quiet setting. Everyone around you is sure to appreciate the jingle and think happy thoughts. I don't know why OEM manufacturers think we need to hear boot up sounds and jingles. Decisions like this make owning a Nexus a must for me. All androids have weak and strong points, but not including the Nexus, most of them have a lot more dumb OEM annoyances that you have to deal with, but I digress. One of many of the biggest secrets to the success of the iPhone- just one. Start putting unnecessary apps from the carrier and stupid bleeps and bloops, startup sounds, etc on the iPhone and I guarantee you the complaints would come in droves. Could you imagine Verizon, AT&T or other carriers forcing apps and software on the iPhone that you couldn't remove? It would totally hurt Apple's sales and people would be in the streets with pitchforks, torches and knives... I'm digressing again.Also, the AOSP keyboard is NOT the same as the Google keyboard, at least mine isn't. Looks exactly the same, but the swype-like slide to text feature wont work for me even though I have it set properly in settings to do so. Had to actually install Google's real keyboard from the Play Store. Obviously a bug. Not a big deal, but worth noting.Besides, having Google's keyboard (or any keyboard from the store) also means it will get updated as needed from the actual store. That won't ever happen with most AOSP keyboards or OEM keyboard unless you get a system update. My keyboard having this glitch is a perfect example. It won't get fixed anytime soon.I do like the overall look of the device. It looks fairly thin and is very light. I ordered a tempered glass screen protector and a simple TPU case for it. I do like the expandable storage, I REALLY like the small bezels, I like that it doesn't have any unnecessary branding on the front of the phone, I like its simplicity, I like that it's not overdone in the software department, I like the price I paid, (although 249 is still a good deal). Really like the front facing speakers and sound. I like the double knock to turn on, which is necessary since the power button is awkward to press. I'm also impressed that the volume button presses adjust to the orientation of the screen. So volume up is always up, and down is down- regardless of orientation. The battery life is surprisingly good, and the camera is actually a bit better than I thought it would be and is more than adequate for basic use. Nice that they threw in HDR with it.I guess the only things I'm not gung-ho about is the cluttery AM/PM (as I overly mentioned), and the other items. It also charges very quickly using its own charger and cord. I used a Samsung plug on it, but it just got really warm and would barely charge, so it may be biased to its own chargers. I'm not sure how fast it would charge speed-wise with an LG, HTC, Motorola etc, or just a generic USB plugin. Anyways the charger and plug-in that it comes with appear to be very good quality. Even my teenage daughter who is always interested in the latest and greatest Android phones, thinks it's a pretty decent phone and that's saying a lot. To her at least its ""not ugly looking."" She actually likes the icon and UI look over her Galaxy (which is kind of fixed on Samsung by using Nova Launcher). She definitely likes that it doesn't have a bunch of applications that she has to turn off or hide, and you can actually uninstall ones you don't want. That's pretty crazy in Android world. User menu is so much easier to navigate than on her Samsung. She's not excited about the camera though. If it had the same camera and screen as the GS-6, I think she would ""possibly"" swap for it ;-)I'm not expecting them to update this phone in the future, although I hope that they do. I may even consider using this as a daily driver if that happens. It would be great to see this get future Lollipop updates or get updated to Android M.Overall this is a really great phone, especially for someone on a budget or someone who wants a decent Android phone that isn't going to turn them off of Android like most low in Android phones will, sending you into the arms of an iPhone in a heartbeat. Even if you're not on a budget, this still is a definte keeper. If Alcatel keeps producing phones like this, they'll be giving the high end phone market a run for their money.","907","Alcatel","2"

Things that I like and things that I’ve noticed are somewhat out of place:Pros:• I love the screen. Bright, laminated, vivid. At this price point, it’s truly a steal.• The speakers get surprisingly loud. At first I was worried of the vibrations they created when turned up to about 70%, but I didn’t notice any distortions.• Cameras are pretty good. The focusing is on the slow side, but it usually gets it right on the first try and the exposure works well for where you tap to focus. Camera tip: to access the gallery when using the camera, just swipe left.• Battery life. I consistently get 4 to 4.5 hours of screen on time. Pretty good in my book, especially coming from a Moto X that could get 2 hours max, if I really stretched it.Cons:I will preface this by saying that I believe these are mostly software bugs that can be easily fixed with an over the air update. If anyone else has these issues or knows a fix, please feel free to comment.• For some reason unbeknownst to me, the battery screen does not show predicted battery life. On my Nexus 7, it will show the projected battery life of my device and approximately when it will reach 0% capacity. Along these lines, I also noticed that the lock screen does not show how long until the battery is fully charged.• Double tap to wake, as many others have pointed out, is gimmicky at best. When it works, which is not very often, it’s great.• My mobile connection does not seem as strong as with my Moto X. The Idol 3 shows that I have no signal in many places around my home that would traditionally have at least 2 bars.• Smart Lock with the Trusted Face function does not always work. Most of the time, it is fine. But, 1 in 30 times the camera won’t even be scanning for my face and just says that it can’t find my face. I go to the “improve face matching” in Settings, but it still says that it “couldn’t find my face”. I know the front facing camera is fine because it works when I use the camera app.All in all, I really enjoy this phone and, of course, it can’t be beat for that price! It’s just some of these software issues are somewhat annoying, so hopefully Alcatel/Google will work on some fixes. I honestly believe that these are just bugs in Android 5.0.2 because my Nexus 7 was very sluggish with the 5.0.2 update, but immediately sped up when it received the 5.1. update.","907","Alcatel","2"

I splurge on the latest new device, only to regret it for some reason or another. Sold my Moto G because the camera was terrible, sold my Note 4 because I think having a $700 phone is ridiculous.Wanted LTE band 12 (T-Mobile is building out their network coverage in rural areas especially with this frequency not supported yet by many phones), a big screen, dual band WiFi, and a price under $300.Initially passed over this phone and Alcatel altogether because it seemed like a very low end brand. This device has changed my opinion of the company. I also looked at the zte zmax and huawei p8 lite, but this Idol 3 seemed to be the best combination of affordability and features.Very customizable and near stock Android lollipop. Great screen, great speakers, decent build quality, decent main camera (seems about as good as my old S4 which was fine), above average front facing camera. Too bad it doesnt have a replaceable battery, but not a huge deal. Doesnt seem like an octa core processor, lagging at times, although not enough to annoy.I usually install custom software on my phones, but after using this phone for a while, turning off double tap to wake, and uninstalling almost all of the preinstalled apps, I like it the way it is.Because it was cheap for a smartphone, I won't be devastated if it gets dropped or cracked. Turn off double tap to wake, uninstall unwanted apps, install a different launcher if you want, install Google keyboard, be careful installing the sim card, dont expect it to behave like a $700 Note 4, and enjoy!","907","Alcatel","2"

The phone was sent from Alcatel so this is no fault of Amazon.The phone itself did seem to have a bit of a lag to it. I see that a lot of reviewers blame this on the specs but It's obviously something in the Alcatel skin. I'm sure a simple OTA could solve this issue. I really had no problems with the double tap feature. It worked every time for me. The screen is very nice for a $250.00 phone. It's very bright and it has very nice color. The speakers are the best feature of the phone. The sound quality of the speakers is very close to my M8. Surprisingly, the headphone jack was rather weak. I didn't try the JBL headphones but my Klipsch headphones were not that loud. My Zenfone 2 has much better headphone output.I would have liked to at least liked to try the phone for a week before giving a review but I couldn't get passed the fact they sent me a used product.

There was no water damage. I think it was the batter. What sucks is that their batteries aren't replaceable. I'm stuck in college now with no phone and 100s of miles away from home. It's not like I needed a reliable phone","907","Alcatel","2"

"896","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","Hey guys. I wanted to wait a while to review this phone so as to give better information about how the phone held up after regular use. Sadly, I smashed the screen and had to get a new one.First things first, I am, and have always been an adroid fan. I love how Android works and have only had Android phones. I've had HTCs, LGs, a Motorola, and two Sony's. I came straight from a Samsung S6 Active to this phone in hopes that I could have the same performance that I have grown to love from Android. I must say, I am very satisfied!! This phone has been awesome! I will say that I am not a gamer and can't provide in sight to how the phone performs in that sense. But, I am a heavy user of all the Google apps, multitasking, YouTube, all that good stuff. The phone is awesome. Front facing speakers are very loud and the screen is top notch.I replaced my 5.5 in Idol 3 for the 4.7 after smashing the screen due to the price tag. I will say that I am happy with the 4.7... BUT... If you are looking to have a solid and powerful device I'd recommend paying the extra money for the 5.5. Read the specs on both and you'll see the main differences between the phones. The 4.7 is a steal of a phone. Especially in a pinch of you need a phone quick. I am convinced you will not be disappointed with it. However, the 5.5 version is just that much better. In my opinion, its the real deal and I am happy to have owned it.It's cool to see other companies producing top quality phones with the same specs as the big companies for a fraction of the price.","907","Alcatel","2"

It was good for i wanna say 7 months maybe and now the problems never end. The power button got stuck somehow and you cant use it and you cant screenshot. It wore out very fast the battery life shortens very quickly. Being how many good reviews i saw for it both me and my significant other ( who has the phone ) were let down.","907","Alcatel","2"
"898","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","4","Update 1: I bought my first Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 in June 2015. 6 months later it wouldn't stop shutting down. I sent it in for repair. However, they did not repair it when I got it back. I am not sure the repairman knew what he was doing. Oddly, the repairman shipped it himself to me too.Update 2: Upon writing to Alcatel through Facebook Messenger, they sent me a brand new phone. Had they not done something to make me satisfied, I would have given a scathing review of this phone. $250 might not seem like a lot, but to me it is. And I would have had to buy a new phone with a budget of probably only $50-$100. Alcatel seems like a good company. Though, they now were just bought out by Nokia.Pros:1. Price: I have had looks at my family member's Apple iPhone's and Samsung Galaxy's and they didn't seem much better than this phone in terms of speed or interface. My father's Samsung Galaxy 5 had a similar problem to mine after 1.5 years of owning it. A phone should last longer than two years in my opinion. However, even if I only get a year out of this phone, it is still a better deal than buying an iPhone or Galaxy because they are around $700-$800. So, I would only be spending $500 for two years. But then, you're in Nexus territory and that's probably a better-made phone.2. Camera: It seems really sharp to me. The ability to take HDR videos is a real plus, but the videos take up about 100 MB per minute.3. Charger: The charger is really fast. It charges in about 1-2 hours. The battery lasts for about a day if you use it a lot. If you put it on Airplane mode as I do at night, the battery goes down maybe 1-2%, which is great.4. Headphones: It comes with a pretty good set of ear-buds. They are much better quality than say a Sony pair for $20 or from the classic Apple iPods from the mid-to-late 2000's. Though, I can't say I really use them ever, because I have a good over-the-ear headphone set and a clip-on $15 one for exercising.5. Large Screen: Everyone that has seen the phone was impressed with its screen size and resolution.Cons:1. Android: I believe sometime after getting this phone, Android made it so that apps could only be stored on an SD card. I haven't completely used the 16 GB (which is really around 11 GB) in downloading apps.2. Text Messaging App: This for some reason doesn't have a ""new line"" button. You either have to send multiple text messages or you have to use the voice-to-text feature and say ""New Line."" All the other apps have a ""new line"" button that appears. It's a really odd gap to leave this out.3. Laggy after Booting or after Prolonged Non-Use: I didn't have this problem in other phones.which were only around $80. But upon rebooting the phone, I have type in my password. However, the keyboard lags in appearing or might not at all if you don't wait long enough for the phone to get its bearings OR the keyboard will appear and it you just won't be able to type on it. This probably happens the majority of the time.This also happens if the phone hasn't been in use for awhile like when I have it in airplane mode at night and then turn it off. This happens probably 1/3 of the time.4. Memo App: Its built-in memo app doesn't have an email function or an option to copy them to an SD card.5. Calendar-to-Map: I put in my addresses for places I need to go to for my appointments. However, if the notification for the even comes up and I click the address, it will open up Google Maps through Chrome instead of just through Maps. It's an extra step that is sort of annoying especially when driving. So, I have to make sure I am ready to go before driving basically.6. Smart Lock: Its trusted places function requires me to have do the same place multiple times if I go to a different level in my house or even a different room.Despite what other reviewers have been saying on here about Alcatel being a horrible company when it comes to customer service, I have found this not to be true so far. Even though they failed to fix my original phone, they got it back to me within a 7-day time frame from the time I sent it in to when I received it.","907","Alcatel","2"

It's a fantastic value. But the primary reason I was shopping for a new phone was that my previous phone had an unreliable GPS unit. I couldn't find much commentary on the GPS unit on the Alcatel but there were some hints that it might be better, so I took a chance. I like to use the phone with the Ramblr app to create GPS tracks of hikes. With my previous phone it would take a long time (five minutes was not unusual) to get a satellite fix so I could start the track. And then the phone would give me bad points occasionally, sometimes freezing at a point in the middle of the hike, requiring extensive editing after the hike to correct the trail. I needed a phone with a better GPS unit, and I found it in the Alcatel One Touch Idol 3! The GPS on this phone just works! Satellite fix at the start of the hike takes just a few seconds, and the track continues flawlessly throughout the hike. If you're looking for an Android phone with a reliable GPS unit, this unit should do a fine job for you.","907","Alcatel","2"

Fairly quick page loading, handles as many apps as you want ( currently 40+ and counting). little to no bloatware, good Bluetooth range, and great speakers. Video quality and sound quality is way above average streaming video and music. I can only see two small drawbacks and one may never be a drawback, only a foreseeable one.One is that the battery is not removable. I have had a phone that would not shut off, with the ""Read It to Me"" app running, reading off text messages with the only alternative to remove the battery to stop it.The other difficulty with this phone is it's dual sim, sd card tray. You must use a little tool to get it out. Then you must balance the chips on the tray and slide it in. So if you tremble then inserting the chips would seem to be impossible to me! I lost a sim chip when pulling the tray out and the chip flying off the tray into the trash.All in all, this is hands down the best phone that I have ever owned. I highly recommend this to any android phone user. I also recommend buying a case and screen protector with your purchase. I have read several other reviews that said it is very fragile. But most phones are fragile in my opinion!One other thing to consider is that this phone runs on Android 6.0.1 so if you want the newest operating system (Marshmallow or better) then don't buy this phone. I have not researched it yet but there may be ways to upgrade the o.s. on this phone","907","Alcatel","2"
"913","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","4","I came to this phone from using a Nexus 4 for the last two and a half years and my initial impressions were very mixed. Starting with the positive things, I love the LTE, the bigger and more color accurate screen, the battery life, the expandable storage, the dual front facing speakers, and how light it is and how thin it is. All big improvements! I also appreciate the very light touch Alcatel used with their skin on Android. It's almost stock.So many great things and yet it was almost all brought down by an Achilles heel. The thing that really bugged me was that moving in and out of apps was really sluggish and choppy and not smooth at all. All of these things are super smooth on the Nexus 4, which is a 2012 phone. Even swipe typing on Google Keyboard was not great. I came pretty close to sending it back and getting a new Moto G.(I have no proof of this, but my guess is that the phone sends almost all of its processes to the slower of the two chipsets in the Snapdragon 615, the one clocked at 1ghz. Unfortunately there's no ""high performance"" option anywhere that would make everything run on the 1.5ghz chipset. The Nexus 4 proves this is plenty to run Android smoothly.)I didn't want to get a Moto G, especially after seeing (and hearing, seriously those speakers are great) this phone. Thankfully, Android is a pretty flexible OS and I was able to take matters into my own hands and make things more palatable. First thing I did was turn all animations off in the developer options. Second thing I did was I installed Nova launcher and selected the options to make things run ""faster than light."" Everything is MUCH smoother after doing those two things. Still not quite as smooth as the Nexus 4, but probably 95% of the way there. Close enough where I can deal with it and I can enjoy the good things about the phone that I admittedly skimped on in the first paragraph.So I really like this phone now. It's everything I wanted. It just took some tinkering to get there.","907","Alcatel","2"

Great performance, UI, very sleek and the dual speakers on the front produce high-quality sound for their size.Most importantly for me and also the reason I recommend this phone to everyone is the outstanding price. Priced at $250 I was able to purchase a 64gb microSD card and a quality case while remaining under my budget of $300. I know some people would prefer the smaller version (4.7""), and it has an even better pricetag at $180.Some flaws would be lack of mobile service providers (Verizon, Sprint) and the inability to access the photo gallery through the camera app, which has been a standard feature of most phones for quite some time now.For me these drawbacks don't impact the overall score of this phone. I had to switch from Verizon to t-mobile, but have had better coverage and a smaller bill as a result. I could see the camera / gallery issue being a nuisance to some people but to me it's a very minor inconvenience.Overall this phone has much to offer. For music fans it has even more to offer, including a turntables feature built-in to the music player allowing you to crossfade between your songs.Strongly consider the Alcatel OneTouch idol 3 if you're searching for a high quality no-contract phone for an exceptional price.","907","Alcatel","2"

I have to toggle it on, then off again to get it to normal. SUPER annoying when you hold a phone with speakers this loud to your ear and someone starts talking. I never use speaker phone or a headset so it has nothing to do with anything but the phone.-This is Alcatel's best and they can't give it Gorilla Glass or comparable? This thing is fragile. Mine slipped off the kitchen counter and landed in a bowl of crunchy dog food and shattered. Yes, I had it in a case. The way the screen sticks out a bit seems to make it a magnet for breakage according to me and what looks like a lot of other people.-Price There seems to be a lot of pretty nice what I would call secondary brand Androids coming out lately. Many of them at this price point and some even lower. This phone is probably $50-$75 more than it should be right now.In conclusion-Do your shopping and comparing wisely. I would bet that most of you reading this review are like me, tired of paying $600+ for Samsung or Apple phones that are also locked. While this and no other phones at this price are, or compare to those brands, I enjoy the savings and my new found freedom. This phone doesn't compare to my Note 4, nor did I expect it to. Also, the truth is that I don't really miss my Note. 95% of the features that made the note so awesome got turned off by me anyhow. I don't use NFC, face tracking, eye scrolling etc. I literally never even used the S-pen. What I did use- this phone has, but so do a lot of reasonably prices phones now. I'm not necessarily saying don't buy it, you might love it. Just make sure you know your options and if you choose this- DON'T DROP IT lol.","907","Alcatel","2"

This is an awesome phone once you replace a few apps. The camera app is so so. I switched to Camera 360. Google camera is also decent. Huge difference. The launcher is ok, but I highly recommend switching to Nova free or some other highly reviewed launcher like Action, Go etc.. Another huge difference can be realized by installing DU Battery Saver. Do these three things and you will have a great phone that has incredible audio, very good camera, and superb battery life. I used to go down to about 30% at the end of the day with my HTC and about 35-45% with this phone until I installed DU battery saver. Now I'm at about 50 to as high as 70% at the end of the day. I recommended my daughter install this on her LG G4. She said she already had it and it didn't help much so this may be phone dependent. I'm not a shill for this app just know it works great with this phone. I really like the fact that it doesn't come pre-installed with much bloatware, and the fact that you can uninstall almost all of it if you want. An absolutely great deal at this price. It's not even debatable. Pay $250 and avoid the provider contracts. You won't be disappointed. Also, their customer service is great. T-Mobile accidentally deactivated my ESN and killed my phone.

The phone's design, however, is of a very well balanced upper-mid range telephone for a lower-mid level price. The sound is fantastic, it has great cameras and the radio will communicate on every T-Mobile and AT&T frequency band in the US (which should include providers that use AT&T or T-Mobile's underlying networks). For T-Mobile customers, the LTE Band 12 (700 MHz) indeed penetrates buildings like only AT&T customers previously enjoyed, when in enable US locations (search for T-Mobile 700 Mhz for more details). The updated radio and being designed for Android version 5 makes this phone more than just a cheaper version of the previous generation's phone, but instead a modern phone albeit a bit easy on the computing horsepower. If you need top processing power, look to the big names' flagship phones; otherwise the Idol 3 will likely fill any other needs (but consider adding an SD Card if you have a lot of media or photos)","907","Alcatel","2"
"937","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","My TakeHere's my take on this phone. I had an HTC 816 on Virgin Mobile. I was very happy with the phone, but looking to get away from the VM service which was spotty in key locations for me. I sold my HTC as soon as this was announced and switched to Cricket with a Lumia 635 to hold me over until this arrived. I did not like the 635 one bit, and I became increasingly anxious for this phone to be delivered. I watched and read all the reviews to hold me over. I got the phone delivered swapped my sim and was up and running in less than 10 minutes. It was a busy holiday weekend with my family, including lots of driving so I didn't get to play with this as much as I would have liked, but I'm finally getting it fully optimized today. I paid $199 for this phone and feel it was an exceptional value. I love the size and ordered a slim case from China ($4 and delivered less than 2 weeks) to protect the edges without adding significant bulk.Here's here I felt this phone met my expectations-1- Battery life seems great so far, enough for 1 day of moderate usage. It seems to be getting better after each charge.2- Display and sound are as advertised and satisfactory in my opinion.3- Phone doesn't seem laggy with normal app usage and video watching. I'm not a gamer so I can't speak for that.4- Look and feel of phone is excellent. The build quality is nice, and doesn't feel any different from a ""true flagship"" with my slim skin on.Here's a couple minor quirks that I didn't love-1- reversible mode sounded cool in theory, but I disabled as I found it silly based on my own preferences.2- Double tap to wake was a little tricky, and I found my phone had awaken in my pocket a few times and opened up apps. I disabled and went back to using power button.All-in-all, I love this phone and think I will grow to enjoy it more as I get more used to it. I use with Cricket wireless service (on AT&T network) and it seems to work flawlessly. Good luck selecting the right phone for you.","907","Alcatel","2"

IMHO, this is a deal breaker for me. seriously thinking on returning this :(.Added image with both phones side by side. The image is from a place where I have excellent reception. From a place where I have poor reception, the nexus 4 has strength approx -108dBm and holds LTE, but idol 3 is less than -120dBm and cannot hold LTE and reverts to HSPA/UMTS.other:antutu 64bit score is ~33000.","907","Alcatel","2"
"939","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","I preface this review by noting that (1) I rarely write product reviews, and (2) I only had this phone for a day so far. With these disclaimers out of the way, I'm simply amazed at the quality and features of this device. Coming from an LG Optimus G and a Fire Phone, the Alcatel Idol 3 is miles and miles better than either device - especially the Fire with its gimped UI and other gimmicks.Amongst the standout features are the high-quality screen, front-facing speakers, and its overall compact size. Alcatel has accomplished quite an engineering feat here by squeezing a huge screen and battery into a package barely larger than 4.7 inch phones out there. This device is also incredibly lightweight at around 140g and, just as important, the weight is evenly distributed. Coming from a 4.7 inch screen devices, I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon...As for the software and other features, I'm happy to report it runs an almost flavor of Android 5.0 (Lollipop). The performance is snappy despite featuring a mid-level chipset in the Snapdragon 615; likewise the camera looks good with only the autofocus being a bit slow. It includes a microSD slot so you can add additional memory cards if necessary. I should mention that it takes microSIM-sized cards in case you're switching from a phone that takes a different form factor of SIM. Last but not least, I use T-Mobile as my carrier and have not fallen off the LTE speed band yet (in the DC area).All in all, I think this is a no-brainer for anyone looking for a new Android phone with a large screen. I spent a lot of time researching prior to making this purchase, especially comparing this to the Asus Zenfone 2, and this Idol 3 won out in the end. Aside from the attractive price and features as mentioned, I have to highlight that this phone includes the LTE Band 12. Band 12 is used exclusively by T-Mobile in the U.S. and supposedly allows better indoor penetration and network reception. Something to keep in mind if you're looking to switch to or currently have T-Mobile, since very phones today have this - the Asus Zenfone 2 certainly does not.","907","Alcatel","2"

The rear camera is 13 megapixel, although it is 4:3 at that quality. I leave it on 10MP (16:9) and the photos it takes are magnificent. The stereo speakers on the front, powered by JBL, are really good too. The phone is light, and thin, making it easy to handle and store.

Tmob reception is better than the OPO by 1.5 bars most of the time. The speakers... omg just awesome full deep sound, focus more on the bass but i prefer that. The build, it is so light and thin i forget it is in my pocket. the brushed plastic on the back feels nice to hold, doesn't attract fingerprints. i was afraid the Dragontrail glass would be a fingerprint magnet, but no it isn't. its been a long time since i had a phone with an FM tuner on it... they need to bring this back. even with music freedom on tmob, using the FM radio uses far far less battery than music streaming. oh and the screen... had one guy say, wow that screen looks great, nuff said with the high brightness and deep blacks, looks like an OLED panel tbh.Cons: hard to think of one, side bezels are so thin expect unauthorized tap registers when holding it tight. forget about using it with one hand. so thin and light it does feel rather... like it needs a case.Verdict = if you don't buy flagships, get this phone.","907","Alcatel","2"

"953","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","UPDATED REVIEW:The phone was repaired, without any problems, and it works perfectly again. The repair center was in Dallas, TX, and they did a good job, in just a few days. The hardest part was filling in the form on their website: getting the IMEI off the phone, getting the proof of purchase, and selecting the proper fields for the issue.This is truly an awesome phone.Now I notice the price has gone down since we bought it, so anybody who wants an Android phone at 5"" or bigger has NO reason to ignore this. At this point, it cannot be beaten for the price (even if, like mine, the networking chip dies and you have to send it off for repair).ORIGINAL REVIEW:I wanted to give 5 stars for this, since it has performed nearly perfectly for the past 2 months. And for the price, this has been the best 5.5"" phone value available anywhere.But sadly, I am worried about the build quality of these phones. Today I woke up, and after 2 months of use, the SIM card is not recognized, and the Wifi is completely dead. The phone has no networking support at all.It seems to be a hardware problem, as I have tried the SIM in another phone and it works fine, and removed SD and SIM, and done factory reset, and the problem is the same. It starts to feel hot on the back, and it will even reboot itself after trying to scan for available Wifi networks when switching the Wifi off and on again.Since Amazon only allows 30 days for returns, I have to figure out how to return it to Alcatel (I hope I can return it after just 2 months). I have another Idol 3 phone, the 4.7"", and it's slightly less than 2 months old. Please wish me luck that this doesn't happen again, and I can get this broken one replaced.","907","Alcatel","2"
"954","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","4","This is a very good phone for a reasonable price. I didn't realize the size I was buying (I thought it was the smaller version), so I'm disappointed with the size. Aside from that, the phone performs admirably, and it's recently been updated with Marshmallow (Android v6).I have experienced some quirks with the phone. The screen sometimes shuts off in the middle of inputting my PIN as though the device were inactive. I have to open it again and start entering the PIN again. The Marshmallow update fixed a problem with the Play Music app, which would lock the phone when starting the app. I had to open the phone, swipe, re-enter the PIN, unlock and then I could actually use the app. As you can imagine, this was very annoying, but it's thankfully fixed with Marshmallow. The first problem persists, though it doesn't happen too often.Reception is good. Battery life is good (for my use, anyway). Screen quality and brightness are good. The interface is a bit awkward because of the phone's large size and button placements. It's a little unwieldy to reach the volume buttons and the power button is tougher. Camera quality is reasonable in good light, but overall it's a poor substitute for a decent camera (or even an iPhone, really). Speakers are very good, stereo, and loud.I probably wouldn't buy it again but only because of its large size. If that doesn't bother you, this is a very good buy.","907","Alcatel","2"

I have had the phone for about 4 months now, and it has been inside a case. The power button has stopped functioning correctly. I can still feel mechanical action of the button functioning correctly, but the button is not working electrically possibly due to a broken solder joint. I say this because I get occasional functionality if I press the button to the point that it feels like it will break the phone, and when this works the screen may flash on and off three times as if it was electrically connected three times.Alcatel's support / warranty requires the owner to pay for shipping to and from their facility, leaving the owner without a phone for the duration of shipping+repairs.

I have had several Blu phones but they seem to be quirky, never get upgraded to the latest operating system and their customer service is bad.I discovered that this Alcatel was a unlocked smartphone and gave it a try. I was impressed as soon as I opened the box! This phone has a 5.5"" screen, same as my old phone, and felt great in my hands.The reception is great and I usually get an LTE signal out here in the corn fields. The JBL speakers are outstanding! They are placed in the front of the phone, one at the top and the other at the bottom. It is great hearing bass when streaming a movie. The only problem with the speakers is that I can not get them turned down just one more notch. The lowest setting is pretty loud and I have tried all the sound settings in the phone. This is my only pet peeve.The phone updated some Alcatel settings as soon as I turned it on then updated its self to Marshmallow right afterwards. There is very little bloatware which is great. You can add a mini SD card and you have a choice between leaving it as is or you can have the phone include the mini SD card into internal memory. You can have 32gb plus what ever you add with a mini card. I added a 32gb mini SD card so now I have 64gb of internal memory.This phone also has NFC which can be used in many ways.

So long story short, broke my Nexus 6 and didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a new phone. I tried out a Sony Ultra C5, I didn’t like the screen at all, otherwise nice phone, so I sold it. Then I tried an LG G3 and it was a great phone but the GPS and camera were terrible. Finally I saw this phone on sale for $99 and figured why not?Well it was a great decision. This phone has been updated to Android 6.01 and everything runs well on it for the most part. This is not a fast phone, but it is a fast enough phone. I am able to browser this Internet, play emulators, and watch movies with ease. Again, it isn’t perfect but for $100, or around that price, it is an amazing value!Highlights:- Fast enough CPU/GPU (with occasional freezes/stuttering, but doesn't get too hot)- Expandable storage- Wonderful front facing speakers that can fill a small room with sound- Decent 1080p IPS LCD screen- Near stock android skin- Excellent all day (with moderate usage) battery life- Fantastic 8mp rear facing camera- Great audio quality with headphones- Surprisingly good call quality- Built in music app is fun and useful- NO BLOATWARELowlights:- Front facing camera is only average with poor low light performance- Multi Media messages like group texts, email texts, and photo texts don’t work on stock messaging app- CPU/GPU does stutter occasionally- Phone is a bit ungainly and slippery in hand for one-hand usagePro-tipsTo fix the MMS bug I mentioned about texts under lowlights, use a third party program off the Google Play Store such as Textra. Additionally, I disabled the “enhanced 4G LTE” setting on the phone and that seemed to help.As for the display, it is great for the price, but it tends to run a little on the “cooler” side in terms of color. You can adjust your color hue under settings. I personally bumped it up one on the color warmth and it looks significantly better. Furthermore, the phone display is extremely bright so things may look a little washed out. To fix this, find an area that is well lit (one that represents where you spend most of your day), and then slide the brightness all the way down, then slowly increase it until you find the colors have the right look about them. Personally, I have mine set to about 35-40% brightness. You can always flip the brightness to “auto” when you go into an extremely bright or dark area.","907","Alcatel","2"

Then I installed my 64 GB SD card and off loaded all the apps I can while setting my camera, voice recorder and music defaults to the SD card ( 16 GBs with only 10 free is pretty low now a days) so with all my apps and cashe totals to about 3.5 gbs combined with 6.5 ish to spare on the phone for apps that can't be off loaded to the SD card.The build reminds me of a better thought out Samsung s4, screen is awesome coming from a flagship HTC m8 and speakers are on par! The plastic build has some defects on the corners, some paint imperfection but you really had to look for it. Peformance wise I didn't noticed much from my HTC m8 I would say I'm not hard core on my mobile devices, just social, YouTube, some games and lot of web browsing. The nice touches of reversibility and double tap to wake are great additions and make a lot of sense ( although I forget its hard to take a picture upside down ). Almost stock android is a delight to use, at first I was so dumbfounded on how much less I had to do to set up the device, which caused me to stare at it and wonder what esle to do.Over all I would give it a 4.5 just because of the small defects in the paint, never the less an awesome phone for the price.","907","Alcatel","2"

"978","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","3","I really, really wanted to love this phone. I mean, what more could you ask for?! Super thin and light. Stereo front facing speakers with amazing sound quality. Full HD screen both bright and crisp. Nearly pure version of Android Lollipop. Respectable battery life. JBL headset IN THE BOX. Attractive looks that are just enough different from the crowd for people to ask, ""hey, what kind of phone is THAT?""Sounds great, right? The problem for me is two-fold. 1) There are only 11 GB of available storage on the phone, which is really, really small. Well, you say, that shouldn't be a problem because it supports Micro SD cards up to 128GB, right? 2) Yes, it does support Micro SD cards but the implementation is almost unusable.You cannot move apps from the phone to the SD card, really. Oh, you have the option in Application Manager to ""Move to SD Card"" but because of the way they've made the filesystem, you only have the ILLUSION of the app actually moving. Move an APP and then go look at the SD Card in File Manager, and you find that NOTHING actually moved.Further, some apps (like Amazon Music) which allow for selecting where files should go, only recognize the SD card SOME of the time. Other times, nada. Also, sometime the SD card wouldn't mount, leaving lots of missed apps and files (even though the apps aren't actually ON the SD Card).Last complaint: Wifi reception and speeds were sketchy compared to all the other devices in my house.In the end, I sent this phone back and bought a used Note 4. I guess $250 is just a little TOO LITTLE to charge for a phone.","907","Alcatel","2"
"979","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","4","First let me tell you that I spend a lot of time reading reviews and on tech sites and am usually the guy in the family that everyone asks for tech advice.After my Nexus 5 screen shattered I was not happy with the state of any of the higher end android phones. They were just too expensive and big. SO after much research i settled on the Idol 3 after reading tons of great reviews.DESIGN: The phone is thin and sleek. I quite like the plastic back. It has a nice feel to it. There's not much flair to the phone but I personally like that. Its a little big and maybe a tad uncomfortable to hold because of how thin is it. The front has two front facing speakers, and there's a notification light up front. The tray that holds the sim card also has a place for you to put in a micro sd card.Camera: Right off the bat I have to tell you that the camera BLEW ME AWAY. In auto mode you get some very good images, but the camera comes in full manual mode that lets you adjust ISO, shutter speed, focus, and white balance. I've gotten some AMAZING images from this phone. Its probably the phone's most under appreciated feature. The camera has other modes, but I almost never touch them.Battery: The battery for me on this phone easily last a day, and with light use will last 2. I can't tell you how nice it is not having to worry if i remembered to pack my charger all the time.Screen: The screen is nice and bright, colors nice and sharp. Its not the sharpest, but its a great screen, and better than most in this price range.Software: The phone comes with almost stock android. The minor changes are generally useful, like letting you restart the phone and put it in airplane mode from the power button (which annoyingly google too out of stock android). Alcatel has not been the best about software updates, but they have been really good about security updates. Since i've own the phone there have been two security updates. This is good! Most cheap phones never even see these.Performance: This is really the only place that the phone falters. Games take a while to open, and if you have too many apps or tabs open, the phone really starts to get sluggish. About once a day I end up closing all apps to release some ram. This generally helps, but sometimes I end up having to restart the phone to get it back. That being said most apps are fine. Apps like facebook or twitter don't have any hang ups.Overall, this phone is such a good value. Except for maybe being a tad too big, and sometimes sluggish performance with more graphic intensive games, this phone is a joy to use. In many ways it best phones costing 3 times as much.","907","Alcatel","2"

I also use it with Ooma's app to make calls over wifi and that works great too. You'll need to be an Ooma customer to use that. I put a 128GB micro sd card in it, that's pretty well loaded with video and music. It doesn't seem to drag performance. I moved what apps allow it to the card. It's a great phone if you watch a lot of video whether it's streaming or using internal storage. I had considered the Moto G until I found out it didn't support wireless display. I had doubts about Alcatel, but this phone has turned out to be superb. The only thing I don't like about it is the button and usb port placement.","907","Alcatel","2"

Overall I'm very impressed. Looks wise I'd rate it about equal to the 1 & better than the zenfone 2.Powerwise the Asus & OnePlus both score better than the Idol 3 & yes I to sometimes notice some lag from time to time. The screen & speakers on the Idol 3 are better than both Oneplus 1 way brighter/louder/better than the Zenfone. As the pro reviews have said it isn't easy to see the Zenfone screen in the sun & here in Texas we have a lot of sun. However the Asus is a super game playing device where I'd advise gamers to avoid the Idol 3. It is great with most everyday tasks like e-mail, messaging, phone calls, & web browsing. Camera-wise the OnePlus (esp video) & Asus 1 are a bit better than the Idol 3 but all three, camera-wise are a good bit below the Apple 6 phones or Samsung S6 amoung others, but for their price they're pretty good. Over all I think the OnePlus 1 is slightly better than this Alcatel Idol 3 but the Asus is the best cheap game phone around. Just use a IEM/headphone for games& music with it 'cause the Asus speaker sucks.","907","Alcatel","2"

Idol 3 has minor software related bugs (songs stutter every once in a while) volume control is rarely unresponsive and may lag from time to time, sometimes the volume responds but the meter on the screen is unresponsive. Phone may become laggy when more than 5 apps are open, so you have to close them. I haven't found any good cases available for the phone yet, the best one I bought was made out of poor material.Videos don't run as smooth as on my xperia z3.Overall: it is a lot for the price, I can find many pros on this phone over sonys flagship at the time of the review (z3) which costed me more than double the price for this one. It delivers more than expect for money on today's market. So considering that I have to give it a 5 star.","907","Alcatel","2"

"987","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","4","Coming from a ZTE Z998, this phone is an enormous upgrade, but does have its quirks. There are many features of the phone that are simply great, but I'll cut the chase and get to the dirt:*Phone is a little laggy at time, especially in Google Chrome.*Double tap to Wake rarely works on time. Sometimes takes up from 1 to 3 minutes for the phone to finally come to the lock screen.*Cellular service signal often just quits. Not sure why, but it is kind of annoying.*LTE signal takes quite a while to lock in. Most of the time the signal comes in with H+. This does effect down/upload speeds.*I've found Bluetooth in my car to be a little quirky. Phone doesn't always sync automatically with my car's Bluetooth. Not sure why?*When getting a phone call with a 3.5 mm jack plugged in and Bluetooth also enabled, call goes through or comes in, but parties on the phone can't hear one another. I've looked into the settings, there may be an issue here?Aside from those issues above, which can likely be worked out if Alcatel ever issues an OTA update, the phone is great. Videos and music are crisp and clear. Games are fun to play, very little lag there. The screen is great! For a phone, the audio is fantastic! You can move your apps over to the SD card to save internal memory. Not all the app data is transferable, but being able to move it over does help. I wish there was a way to control where your ""downloads"" save file to, but unfortunately there is not and a download automatically saves to the phone's memory. You have to make a conscious effort to move the file over to the SD card, as to not consume your internal memory. 11 GB's of memory doesn't go too far these days.For the money at $250, this phone is a pretty good buy and worth the money. It is clear however where Alcatel cut some corners to stay in the $250 price range and still make profit. Too bad phones are so throw away after 2 years of use. Guess that's the nature of technology and people always wanting something better. Enjoy the phone!Screen protector and a phone case are a must if you want to preserve any phone for at least 2 years. There aren't too many phone case options for this phone yet thought. :-(","907","Alcatel","2"

"993","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","My 1st impression upon opening the box was ""wow, this is gorgeous"". Yes the back is plastic, but the build quality, color, finish and overall design makes it look and feel like a premium product. I was pleasantly surprised at how sturdy yet lightweight it was when I first picked it up. Turning it on made me feel even more wowed. The screen is just gorgeous, probably the best that I've seen. It's sharp, hi-res, great colors, and the GUI and near stock Android experience makes the experience that much better (unlike Samsung or other phones where they have great screens but the GUI ruins the premium feel).There's some lag when I'm going from app to app, but I'd say it is something I can live with, it doesn't happen all the time and closing all the apps seems to remedy this problem. I'm able to play the latest games, and for the most part it's a fast experience.I was worried about the camera from all the reviews and 100% cropped sample images I saw on the web. But actually after several test shots I'm surprised that the photos turned out well. The photos are a little smudgy when zoomed 100%, and low light performance could be better, but when I'm viewing them on FB or just zoomed out on my pc, the photos are very clear, good contrast and decent colors. The quality reminds me of an entry to mid-level point and shoot camera, or an iPhone 4s or 5. I wouldn't zoom in all the way or print these photos that's for sure, but the camera is actually better than what all the reviews online have made it seem (it's a 250 dollar phone for crying out loud).Overall this phone is a steal at 250 bucks. I'm thinking of buying 1 for both my parents. I would not hesitate to buy this at all, and the best part, it's an affordable phone that doesn't look like an iPhone.","907","Alcatel","2"

It stands up well against the so called ""flagship"" phones. For those looking at $100 phones, my advice would be to save your money and wait until you can buy the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 which is very reasonably priced for what it brings to the table. This phone is a very lightly skinned pure Android phone, which Alcatel did such a great job with I no longer need a launcher such as Nova. Over the air updates are also a major plus. The build quality is fantastic. This phone has a metal center body wrapped top and bottom with aluminum or stainless steel bands -- I can't tell which. The top band also wraps over the stereo speakers. The back is textured plastic, which is a must because it wont interfere with the internal antennas. I also like the slide out sim and SD card tray and the full 1080P display. Those things, and much more, are what you would normally pay $1K if you bought a ""flagship"" phone. One word of advice, leave the display brightness on ""auto"" or you'll use too much battery. Other than that, battery life is fantastic no matter how much you use this phone during the day. Alcatel would sell a lot more phones if they'd list more technical features for their phones, and I'm not really sure why they don't. I could write a lot more, but let's suffice to say, I am not easy to please but I am very happy with this phone. Normally I would find something I don't like, but in this case, that didn't happen.","907","Alcatel","2"

"999","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","A lot of people have suggested that a power user should really go for one of the top tier flagship phones where they don't compromise on CPU, RAM, display etc. I am a software developer and most definitely a power user. I take a lot of time to customize my phone and I use it very heavily and I can say without a doubt, I will never spend $500 on a phone again now that I have seen what $250 can buy.If you know how to manage your memory, this phone is very snappy. I haven't done much in the way of 3D gaming so I can't comment on that but that's not a power user thing. That's a teenager nerd boy thing. If you want a mobile gaming platform for your spoiled brat, you may want to spend more. I for one couldn't imagine spending $600 or more on a phone that will probably get broken in your kids backpack, but that's your call.The display is quite nice, clear, bright colors. The camera is even quite good. The battery could be better but it still lasts me a full day with heavy use. I'm not a big fan of the stock user interface but now that I've loaded Apex Launcher, that's been resolved anyways. There are a ton of launcher options out there and they all offer a better than stock user experience in my opinion. I highly recommend Nova, Apex or Hola Launcher but there are a bunch out there worth exploring. I'm happy with Apex but I like to explore and see what else is possible.Still, if all of that was good but the call quality was bad, this wouldn't not be a positive rating. That was a major concern for me since there are some ratings out there that knock the call quality. I really don't understand professional reviewers on sites like C-Net or PC Mag that give a glowing review of the phone when the one negative is the poor call quality. It's a smartPHONE. The PHONE part should be the most important. Anyways, while it's not the best call quality I've had, it's actually quite good. The only complaint I have about call quality is that I sound a little tin to the user on the other end of the call. They can still hear me clearly, even in a noisy environment and there's no reverb or echo or scratchiness. The sound quality on my end is quite good also, including the speakerphone. Also, I get a better (cell radio) signal with this phone than I did with my T-Mobile HTC One or my unlocked Sony Z3 which means I can make calls in places where I couldn't with those phones and I have less likelihood of having a call dropped.For this price point, it's a fantastic phone. I used to only buy flagship phones for between $500 and $700 and I always felt ripped off (Sony, Samsung, HTC). This is the first phone purchase I've made in the last 7 years that I feel like I got my money's worth (and then some).Bottom line, if you are in the market for a flagship phone, consider what you will actually be using it for. Then consider saving yourself some money.","907","Alcatel","2"

Everything works well.However, after having used it for some months, then trying out an HTC m7 with a 4.7 inch screen, I wish I had gone with the 4.8inch version of the Alcatel oneTouch Idol. While readability and viewing videos from a distance is nice, the 5.5"" screen is too clumsy, too difficult to hold in one hand, and too long to fit in a pocket. It just scares me. I live in fear that it will grow too big for me to safely control anymore, and one day it will take over my life.It is also incredibly slippery without a case. More points off for handle-ability. I think they grease the backside with Crisco. This, combined with the clumsy size, makes it super easy to slip out of your hand.Even with the case (I bought here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZOER95Q?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage) it is difficult to keep in one place. It's a slippery fish just waiting to flop around and escape your grasp to fulfill its secret plans of world domination.","907","Alcatel","2"

For those interested in this phone it is under $100 here on Amazon. I find that a great price for a beginner smart phone or for a person who isn't interested in all the bells and whistles of a $700 phone. This thing gets the job done for me running on Android 6.0.1. Ok now for the reason why I gave it 4/5 stars. The phone battery gets warm to the touch under heavy use like watching videos which causes it to kind of feel sluggish. The camera is weak under low light conditions but that didn't bother me since I rarely used the camera. Video quality is alright in clear conditions but like the camera I had no use for that feature. Finally battery life is not that great if you find yourself away from an outlet. Good thing it charges fast. I could go into other features but it really is just a phone for me to keep in touch with family and work. One final thing. The up front dual speakers make listening to music fun. No more cupping the speaker to redirect the sound!","907","Alcatel","2"

This turns the display on and causes the battery to drain quickly.When the battery fully drains the phone doesn't turn on even at full charge, it has to be overcharged for another hour before it turns on. Had to charge mine 10 hours last time battery complete drained before it would turn back on.The person who said this review is not helpful was probably a shill working for this crap company.","907","Alcatel","2"

I have been using the phone for less than 2 weeks and I am very close to flushing it down the toilet! Within a few days of using it, i noticed it started freezing for hours on end and only a battery pull can resolve that temporarily.... Please note that I have only ever downloaded one app and that's whatsapp. About the 5th day of using the phone, I noticed that it began shutting down on its own, sometimes it restarts, most times it doesn't. Another issue is that the wifi keeps turning off on its own or just jumping off the internet. Also, the mobile data also spontaneously turns off by itself. Yes, that's 4 issues in just about 12 days of owning this phone. It has now become the bane of my existence! I am so frustrated with this phone, they don't even deserve 1/16th of a star! I will never purchase this phone ever again and I wouldn't want it even if I was being gifted one! I will also warn everyone I know not to purchase this phone, for the statisfaction they will receive from the reasonable price will surely be negated shortly thereafter with the range of issues that this phone has. I guess I will just have to dig deeper and purchase a more reliable phone that will undoubtedly cost me 4 times than what I paid for this, I felt like I wasted my $200. I am certain of one thing, an Alcatel phone will never be brought into my home again! People be warned.... Don't waste your energy, money or time, just save until you can get a better phone, one with warranty and some accountability on the company's part and most importantly never purchase a phone over Amazon. I am totally dissatisfied with the entire purchase as I also never received the Mr. shield screen protector and when I contacted them they told me to contact Amazon! I should have known this was a raw deal and returned everything! Alas, this will never ever happen again. Worst purchase ever!","907","Alcatel","2"

If it costs more than 99 dollars I would send it back . I picked it up for a back up phone. I decided to give it a test drive. This phone isn't very powerful . I am going to give a review on what's important to me. 1. Signal. It's allover the place fading in from full bars to no bars of LTE . I discovered if I put it in hspa it's fairly stable . In areas that have a great LTE Signal It's fantastic. 2. Call quality. It's middle of the road not great , not horrible. The moto g4 plus is way better , but the g4 has VOLTE . The idol 3 doesnt.3, battery , it's a little better than okay . If I don't use it , it will last . If I do use it it is just like every other phone .4. Responsiveness. I have a galaxy s7 edge . I am used to touchwiz lag . This phone lags as much as my Samsung . I did change the settings in developer options. 5. Screen ..not bad its fairly bright. 6. Storage it's been updated to 6.1,1. It now has adaptive storage . Buy a good SD card if you are going to use it as adaptive storage.7. Size for 5.5 it feels pretty small and very light. I put a glass screen protector on and my favorite slim case. It feels and looks pretty nice.8. Emails and text they work well. I think if t-mobile didn't force Alcatel to disable band 12 (or if Alcatel paid for band 12 license this review would be better. All in all if you can grab it for 99$ do it. But for more go with the honor 5x or moto g4 . For some reason I like this phone .its over a year old now and still a decent performer .","907","Alcatel","2"

On a recent trip, I was amazed at how useful their phones were during our travel (Uber, Lyfte, AirBNB, Airline information, Maps) and decided I would get ready for my contract renewal in a few months, by getting a cheap smartphone and loading it up, via WIFI connection at home. Read the reviews and this one was priced at $99. Why not? It's been a week, and it has been eye-opening. It's replacing my clip on MP3 player, cause it plays MP4s as well. The sound is incredible. I have a 64 GB microSD with all my music, that I hot swap into the phone's dual slide. The slide has space for a microSD and a SIM card. I enjoy the built-in radio, Skyping, and using Viber on my WIFI. I've got apps to read Word and Excel documents, my G-mail updates...it goes on and on. It does take around 20 seconds to boot to a visible screen once you press the on button, and I think that may fool many into thinking the phone isn't working, as they repeating hit the on/off button. Just push on, and have patience. The OS also rebooted several times over the first few days, but after a week, that has finally stopped. Camera takes good pictures but not great. It's been fun, and I haven't even activated my phone yet. Once I do, and probably with Cricket, which uses AT&T towers, everything should be ready and I won't have a learning curve.","907","Alcatel","2"

"1035","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","I felt like I should write a review on this as a ""average"" phone user.I am a tech guy and have worked in IT for over 15 years, but I don't have to have the best of the new phones. I use mine for mail constantly, browsing 10 or so times a day, usually just to look something up quickly at home. Facebook at night a few times maybe, every once in a while games, but usually just basic stuff like Spades or backgammon, every once in awhile some ""better"" game. Maybe 50 texts a month on average.On to the phone, keep in mind I am coming from a Razr MI ordered 2 of these to replace to Razr M's on Verizon and we were switching over to Cricket wireless so perfect time for this phone to release.Setup - super easy, Turned on the phone, picked my language, setup my wireless connection, and it let me know there was a 50+mb update. Took like 3 seconds to download it and then it installed and rebooted,It then prompted me to setup or transfer my account, I figured hey transfer it, it told me to put my old phone back to back and seconds later my account had transferred over.The screen is huge compared to what I am used to, and very bright, I have it on auto-adjust but it's usually around 20% brightness, it is so bright.I don't use my phone while walking to text or do Facebook etc. but I have checked notifications outside, no problems reading in sunlight. Colors look fine to me, at least for what I need.Audio is pretty loud, the dual stereo speakers are more than what I would expect out of my phone.If I want to share a YouTube video with someone we both have no problems hearing it play.Web browsing, I have had no real problems or lag as some others seem to have had, but I do limit what I browse to on my phone, I don't go to some of the sites that have tons of ads etc. on my phone. I have no problems with slickdeals or dealnews like some people have mentioned.Wi-Fi speed is awesome on mine, I am on 5G in my house and it's so much faster than my old phone or my laptops. It's actually just as fast as my main rig on a wired connection. Every test I have run is over 55mb down and 6mb up and I am on a 50/5 plan. For me it's very fast as tested by Ookla on multiple servers.Data speed, I don't use much as I am on wireless at home and at work, but I have had 4gLTE everywhere I have checked it and I am in Northern Idaho which doesn't have near the same coverage as say Seattle.I haven't had any problems with any apps installing or crashing.Actually I have several apps that seem to work a lot better.Fitbit, and Yamaha AV Controller for example work so much better and quickerBluetooth is great, synced to my car easier than my last 2 phones did, has extra security on ""trusted"" devices for both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices.Supports USB and Wi-Fi tethering, both of which I will probably never use.I have a 64gb SD card in mine and the limited access I have used it for has been fine.Reversible mode works and is neat to show people, but I like most people will usually pick up my phone the right way, but it makes handing your phone to someone else easier if you want to show them something.Tap to wake - this is discussed a lot, works fine every time for sleep, but it does seem like some app installs make it wonky. If I go back into gestures and turn it off and then turn it back on it seems to fix the problem.Not all apps break it, but I have had it happen twice now.I don't have a problem with the power button on the left, fine by me, better than on the top like some phones.Included apps don't bother me at all, and lollipop seems to run fine on my phone.Some people have had problems etc. but anyone who has been around tech knows, all companies, all products, ship bad batches.Phone is very light but I am getting used to it already, I have it in a case which has made it not seem so fragile anymore.Overall I really like the phone and for $200 pre-ordered I am more than happy. Plus I used turbo-tax this year so bonus Amazon gift-cards paid for mine.As for the camera, I haven't used it yet, I take pictures on family outings etc. but haven't had the chance yet.Plus if I know I am going somewhere I will want to take pictures ahead of time I am going to take my DSLR.I honestly don't care what the camera is like on my phone to be honest, but the little I have seen will be fine for my needs.I paid more for each of my lenses on my DSLR then I did for this phone, so what do I expect right?There are some other things I could talk about, but that is the gist of what I am going to use the phone for.Update:7:00 a.m. 5/28 took it off the charger - 10:18 p.m. 5/29 44% left on the battery after 2 days of use, several phone calls and 6 trips in the car synced to the car.Also should note you can go into the specifics of the battery and view Wi-Fi and network strength as well as screen-on time for the entire time broken down by the hour since last charged.At this rate I could make it almost 2 more days before running out of battery.Also should note I have the notification LED off and the notification tone set to only go off once when something comes in.Update 6/3 I took my wife's off the charger 5/28 and she has used it mildly since then. She has been home a few of the days, but still uses it everyday a little. As of 9:00 last night phone was at 50%. Pretty dang good. Keep in mind my old Razr M had to be charged halfway through the day at this point due to shortened battery life. So being able to go for days is so nice. I went 4 days on my last charge as well. But I didn't make it to 6 like the wife did.Still enjoying the phone, I still cannot believe how much better all my apps work on the new phone compared to on KitKat.Update 7/13 For those that were asking 52 days, just got upgraded to 5.0.2 today on the firmware. So they are updating pretty well since it's product launch time hasn't even been 2 months and they already have 2 updates plus dealing with all the BS from a product launch so overall I would say pretty good.Still love the phone, I would say the battery life is a little shorter than I first thought but I think it's because it works so well I find myself using it a lot more than I used to use my old phone.Still a great value for the money for me.","907","Alcatel","2"

"1039","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","A very solid phone for the asking price.I was able to purchase this device during promotion for 199 dollar, but in this review i will compare to the Mate 2, Note 4 and Nexus 4, iphone5, which at the time of my purchase was 300 dollar, 750 dollar, 360 dollar and 600 dollar. I'd like to mention that the asus zenfone 2 is a very capable phone and priced at 199/299, but i do not have a unit to compare with.pro1. build quality is superb. the phone is assembled with high precision, the unit is very thin and very solid. the entire phone has no creaking when pressed and each button has very nice tactile feel. it is very similar to the feeling of Nexus 4, which was also superb in term of build quality and overall finishing.2. the speaker is superb. it is up there with HTC boomsound and i think it might actually better at bass (HTC may be better at treble). at any rate. the speaker is miles apart from anything else and even better than most tables (that includes ipad). the true stereo speaker and high definition sound (for a phone) really helps when you watch video or play game without headphones or boombox. and most importantly, this phone's speaker are very well placed and it hides within the frames. so all the glory without HTC's huge ugly speaker grills.3. screen is awesome. it has one of the brightest screen on a phone. no issue to use in the day light and it is capable of display vivid images at a extreme wide angle. it easily rivals the screen found on iphone 5. in the realm of IPS, this screen is as good as it goes. (but i still prefer the ALMOED on Note 4 better for its deep contrast).4. stock andriod. pretty much the vanilla andriod with very little touch to add alcatel's reversible screen. which means very little overhead and smooth operation.5. support SD card. while most say SD card is useless, i would not purchase a device without capability of expanding storage. i often travel for business and leisure. and many place i go does not have cellphone reception or in an country that cell data is very slow. I always keep the Here map and its offline data in my phone in case i need direction, and that's a good 15 to 20G of data all by itself. and if one uses the phone to take photo or video, he/she will use few gig of storage in a week or two. bottom line, after 9 month of using Note 4, i have already exhausted the 64G SD card and just moved to 200G SD card. and having SD card on a phone, even if you don't think you need it, is a big plus to me.average1. camera is very average for 2015 flagship phone (but very good for 2013 standard). the only other phone i have at the time of the photo comparison is Note 4, which was released in 2014 but has one of the very best camera in smart phone at the time of this review. compared with Note 4, the onetouch idol lacks resolution, white balancing and image sharpness in pretty much any lighting condition. However, i would say that Idol3 does perform very well compared to the flagship phone from two generations ago (e.g. iphone5, Galaxy S4). do bear in mind that this phone does not have a sticking out camera housing like the latest smart phones, and this phone is VERY thin (7.4 mm compared with iphone 5's 7.6 mm). it's optics will suffer even with a capable CMOS sensor.2. performance. again, this phone would have no problem when compared with flagship phones from two generations ago (like HTC M7, S4 or iPhone 5) and might even be slightly faster. which is to say that phone is perfectly capable for daily tasks such as reading email, browsing web or play games (even the very intensive games like implosion). you would probably see occasion lag when scrolling through a huge PDF file or some complicated websites, or a longer loading time for games, but not a deal breaker in my mind. it is not until you doing transcoding or running benchmarks will you see the huge difference between current gen flagship and this phone, but who dose transcoding in the phone anyways?3. reception. in the same location, this phone's reported reception is always about 11 to 15 dbm lower than the Note 4. which would technically translate to 20% of signal strength (since the highest is probably -60 dbm if you standing right next to the tower and lowest usable cell phone strength is around -125).4. compromises: with such wonderful design and display, there are sacrifices has to be made for this release price. for one thing: you don't have 802.11 ac, you don't have Magnetometer or a Gyroscope, all of which zenfone 2 has for similar and cheaper MSRP (199). while i do miss the magnetometer and gyroscope for fast location and direction. i do not miss the 802.11 ac feature. the ac allows you to transfer files at a much greater speed (about twice as fast compared to n in my test with computers), but this is completely useless because the phone's internal storage is so slow that it doesn't matter how fast you can pull down the data. at least on my Note 4, the transfer rate doesn't seem to have any difference when running ac or n.4. processor: i am not against weak processors and i have said this processor does do it job. BUT the 615 is just gimmicky. technically with its octa core, it should be little-big design that you have two cluster of computing units, one is fast but power hungry (A57/A15) while another (A53/A7) is slow but power efficient. but in this device, you have 8 A53 core, just one cluster is clocked faster. REALLY??? qualcomm has no reason to not just release it with standard 4core A53s and add a speed governor to achieve the same effect. in fact, qualcomm said themselves that 615 was released due to market demand for more cores not due to power efficiency or performance. i'd much rather see a 801 or intel's core in this phone than 615 for the similar price.overall, a very solid phone that actually have a good design. it is one of those product that doesn't do all the justice just by reading the spec sheet. you have to see it in person and feel it in hand to appreciate its craftsmanship and balanced performance. while not perfect, it does have a lot of merit for its price tag even at 250 USD.

"1040","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","1","I decided to put down my big name flagship for a bit, and was pleasantly surprised.This device boasts a bright (even on low) large screen, decent processor, Android Lollipop, front facing speakers, good battery life, and LTE band 12 that I need on T-Mobile. And that whole package comes in at an insanely low price.It's not as fast as my Oneplus One's 801 processor, but overall I'll take front facing speakers and better LTE over minimal processor speed gains. It is an octacore 64 bit, so it's no snail, it can compete with any big name device. IMHO the speed races are over, and software/hardware optimization is key, which Alcatel did a great job.Oh and this brings JBL headphones, it's rare that any OEM puts accessories with devices now, some don't even include chargers.Software wise, it's very much Vanilla like. The screen rotates no matter which way you turn it, it adjusts to you. Also, you can double tap to wake AND to sleep. It's the simple things that I love. And since it's running on Snapdragon, you won't have compatibility issues (Intel) or slow downs (Mediatek).Ultimately I was too used to my Oneplus customizations so the OPO called back to me. But if I didn't have my old flagship killer, this would be my phone. I'm recommending this device to everyone!*UPDATE*I had the device in a case, and screen protector. It suffered its first drop, from hands, and the screen shattered. Be VERY CAREFUL.Also, I plan on getting a tempered glass protector once I get it back.In case I run into any issues on RMA I'm paying for, I'll update.*UPDATE 2Really expensive repair service. $39.99 triage fee charged whether you get it repaired or not, if you don't pay it you don't get your phone back.+$54 for a screen replacementI'm done with Alcatel","907","Alcatel","2"
"1041","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","I caught this during their pre-release. At the time I was thinking about replacing my cracked screen Note 2. My phone was still functional, but it has been a couple years. Since the Note 5 should be released soon, I purchased this inexpensive phone in the interim. I wasn't expecting so much, other than it to hold me over.Pulling it out of the packaging, immediately, it felt slim and light. Almost light to the point of cheapness. That feeling has gone away since, now I appreciate how slick and light weight it is.I fired it up, the screen looks beautiful. Bright, with great color too. Turned it back off, inserted my sim card and sd card. That was a bit cumbersome compared to previous phones that I have had, but given the slim nature of the design, it may have been a necessity. After getting it all setup, and navigating around a bit, I found it pretty snappy. I downloaded my normal apps, and installed Aviate, the launcher which I have been using since beta and find very clean.If you're coming from 4.x Android or another OS, you won't have the small gripes that I have. I had installed Cyanogenmod 12.1 on my note 2 before switching to this phone and there are quite a few features I miss from that version. These are minor, and in no way have a significant negative affect on how I like this phone. The fact you can use the phone, or any app upside down is a neat idea, but in practice, your buttons are in the wrong spot, and it still feels upside down. The camera seems good, but I am no camera expert, and only take pictures from time to time.Over the past week or so, here is what I found that stands out:Good:Front facing speakersScreen quality, bright and detailedLight weight*** PRICE *** I doubt you'll find anything close in this price range, rivals $500+ phones imoBattery lifeCall quality via hand set, speaker phone and bluetoothNot so good:Not a lot of case optionsOther notes that may affect your purchase decision:Charging port position is off center, awkward, and may interfere with some cradlesPower button feels like it is in the wrong spotNon-removable battery, may be no issue, I haven't ever replaced a battery in my other phones, and I expect one to last at least a couple years which is fine to me.Bottom line for me:I was surprised how good this phone is. Initially it was supposed to be temporary, but I will keep it until I break it. Good phone, crazy awesome price! Unless you want the specific name brand, buy this, you won't be sorry.6/3/15Updated observations:When in a phone call, the screen doesn't rotate, even when just using bluetooth. This causes a small issue when I want to go from a phone call to using navigation software since I want the landscape view. As soon as the call hangs up, it rotates how it should.I had one random reset, of course this was while I was navigating downtown Seattle and needed to know my next turn.I took the time to watch video on this, and the audio is AWESOME!Battery life is definitely acceptable for me, not the best or worst. It lasts me more than all day though with moderate use.There is a feature that can be turned on that allows you to tap twice to turn on/off the screen, that does not work so well.7/7/15Ended up with a very small scratch on the screen, probably from my keys, so if you pick this up, get a screen protector.Still overall a five star purchase to me!","907","Alcatel","2"

Battery like is solid and the added benefit of expandable storage with a very stock interface (after adding the Google launcher) are an added bonus. The only issue with this phone is the camera.

Because it isnt a flagship there isnt any ""forced"" signing into your personal email, google or other accounts. Pop a sim card in and you're good to go!Now to the phone itself, the video display is amazing so crisp and clear. I tend to have my phone in the lowest brightness setting all the time to preserve battery life and the video is still amazing.The pictures and videos the phone take are to cool, I love the time lapse that saves as a video file. My wife has the same phone and loves using Snapchat with it, even though there is no front flash.I like playing games on mine and the size of this thing makes it so easy, because the ram is so good there is no lag/freezing.

Good camera and speakers. It has band 12 for Tmobile LTE. Unlocked for any carrier.My issues with it are the button placement for power and volume. The power button should have been placed halfway down the phone instead of right across from the volume buttons. I often trigger a screenshot when i just wanted to turn the screen off. As time goes on I am getting used to the placement and I make those errors less often. Also, the double tap to sleep/wake up is not always responsive.

Yes, there is some bloatware but, there are some good apps to remove what you don't want. The JBL headphones that come with this phone are a nice added bonus. Packaging is very nice also. Alcatel really hit the mark with this one. Let's just hope they keep up. The only bad which may not be bad for everyone, is the reversal of the on/off and volume buttons.

Gets periodic updates and hopefully will be getting Marshmallow sometime in the near future, though I'm not sure when that will be. Good battery life, quick to charge. Nice screen, but I did also get a tempered glass protector.My only complaint is that it is a bit laggy. Sometimes when you click to launch an app or double tap to wake, it take the phone a second before anything starts to happen. It's kind of a pain when you think you touched something and are waiting for the app to open, only to find you have not actually touched it are are just staring at your phone like a goon.

It is not intended to replace parts and the cost of replacement is more than would be worth it. I like the phone enough as an inexpensive smart phone that I ordered and received the replacement from amazon within 3 days (I paid for fast delivery). Quickly got up and running. A major feature is that the phone will accept up to 128GIGs of a mini memory card. I use this large memory to hold music, audible books, pictures and large spreadsheets. Unfortunately many apps (for example x-plore, do not recognize the added memory). My favorite picture viewer QuickPic does so without any problem..","907","Alcatel","2"

Very clear. Awesome reversible UI so that you can have the phone in any orientation and use it, even for calls (look up a video for this). Runs Android Lollipop, so it's basically top tier. Battery life lasts me all day with very very heavy gaming use, and a few days with light to moderate use.

"1098","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","I like my phone for reasons that have already been stated more eloquently by others, so my review is going going to focus more on turning some of the dislikes I have read into likes:1.) Double Tap to Wake is not on by default. You need to enable it in the settings.2.) Double Tap to Wake is not 100% compatible with 3rd party launchers. It loses about 50% of its functionality on a 3rd party launcher IIRC. Personally, I was coming from the Google Now Launcher. (ProTip: I missed having the Google Now cards show when I swiped to the left of the home screen. One old work-around that I forgot existed is that I can just swipe up from the Home screen button (The 'O' button). Quick way to launch Google Now Launcher without making it the standard launcher or going to the app tray.) With that said, even on the Alcatel OneTouch Launcher, Double Tap to Wake is not 100% efficient. It is especially finicky when you try to use the feature to wake a phone that has entered deep sleep mode. However, if pushing the power button with your finger is a deal breaker, then that is some serious #FirstWorldProblems. I have no issues doing that one handed and my hands have never been big enough to palm a basketball.3.) Delete the (small amount of) bloatware to eliminate any unnecessary apps running in the background. This can assist in speeding up your phone if you are having issues. For example, I read that the AVG Anti-virus app specifically can cause a lot of lag on the phone since it is running in the background 24/7. Never had a need for Anti-virus scanner on Android yet so it was the first thing I trashed.4.) Personally I have been pleasantly surprised by the camera. Granted my previous phone had a mediocre camera, but still. One thing I've started doing that I've never done before is to tap the screen to focus the camera prior to taking pictures. This has been an Android feature for a while, but I just started using it and I really like how my photos are coming out, even at night. Alternatively, over at the Idol 3 XDA Forums, there are suggestions on other Camera apps to download, as well as manual settings to get the most out of your pictures if you are unhappy with the default options.5.) Try a factory reset if you are experiencing any issues after an OTA update. I think this is more to do with Lollipop than Alcatel because my other Android devices also were a little buggy after OTA updates to Lollipop until I completed a factory reset.If those suggestions do not address your concerns, Alcatel has confirmed via an email response to some XDA members that they are working on releasing another OTA update after reviewing feedback from the community.At the end of the day, many professional tech sites have stated that this is the budget phone of 2015 with good reason. Even if you think that professional reviewers are biased, here on Amazon, the current numbers as of 6/6/15 show 80% of Idol 3 reviewers gave the phone 4 stars or better. At the time of writing, the Amazon reviews of the OPO is 80% as well while the ZenFone 2 has 78% of reviews garnering 4 stars or better.","907","Alcatel","2"
"1099","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","1","So I am usually not rushing to write reviews, however, it doesn't take very much time to conclude that it is a somewhat mediocre device and falls terribly and disappointingly short of satisfaction. Consider this rating a scale from 1-3 stars and I'll explain why. Depending on what you are looking for in a cell phone, the rating will go up or down. At least this is what I have seen in other reviews. I'll cut to the chase:PRO1. SPEAKERS/JBL Sound system is AMAZING. To the point that music played on this thing out plays my lap top speakers! Believe it or not. You are carrying a mini boombox. Alcatel gets 5 star is this area. They can be too loud nonetheless so please be careful and considerate or you are going to sound like that person in a relatively nice SUV with a so so speaker system that rattles.5. Look is okay. My friend thought it was an I phone or something more expensive/high end. The phone is super light.2. Screen resolution is okay. Not 4k but c'mon it's HD. I am sorry to hear reviews from people that have received defect units.CON:3. THE DOUBLE TAP FUNCTION IS ALMOST NON-EXISTENT. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS AN ALCATEL OR SOFTWARE PROBLEM. Most likely something to do with the device. All of these 4 and 5 stars received excellent/polished devices with no problems, which I find really hard to believe. This is annoying. You will just have to use the power button to turn on and off.6. SIM CARD DID NOT READ APPLICATIONS I HAD BEFORE AND OVERALL PHONE INTERFACE CAN TAKE TIME TO TAKE USE TO.6.5 I don't think Screen is scratch resistant.7. PHONE CAN BE SLUGGISH WHICH IS ANNOYING!!!. I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS FROM A $250 DOLLAR PHONE. I HAVE AN OLD LG F6 Metro PCS phone and with all honesty, I don't know which is slower or faster at times. Some applications stopped working all together and I had to uninstall and install again. WTF<---!!! Really.*Caveat. My employer subsidized 50% of the cost which meant I only paid $125 out of pocket for this cell phone. BUT I am trying my best to be objective here and I can also say that I would not have paid $250 for this phone.which brings me to item number 8.8. coverage with AT&T drops randomly!!!!!!!. I DON""T CARE HOW MANY #1 or #2 STAR REVIEWS THIS PHONE HAS ON AMAZON. THIS along with the laggyness of the phone dropped this review from a solid 3 to a 2 star. A ONE STAR DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN MY BOOK OF REVIEWING. I was hesitant in rating this a 2 or 3 star but this made it clear. I am not crying about having 4gLTE 10000% percent of the time but when you can't hear someone because your bars just drop when other phones don't drop signal *in a good area with good reception (this statement compares other cell phones in the house) Just doesn't make sense.*second caveat. I don't pay for monthly service or service at all. BUT STILL, I WOULD NOT WANT TO PAY FOR SERVICE JUST TO HAVE A GOOD LOOKING TOY PHONE WITH GOOD SPEAKERS. NOPE. SORRY.This would be a better choice if the presale price of $200 stayed or if it was less because this is what this phone is worth. IN MY OPINION!!!9. CHIPSET and ram are a bit below mid range in terms of specs. Nothing great to be honest especially when we are entering the age of 3 and 4 Ram cell phones with Snapdragon chipsets in the 800 range and Melta kits etc.10. Battery life, at least in my case has not been impressive. I don't know if it's my device or what. But I have been using this phone not to slightly and not to heavy and it appears that the battery drains rather quickly compared to most of the reviews here and online that are boasting about this phones battery life.11.5 Phone gets warm to the point of hot near the camera when in use. Not even using for hours. Just using. This is alarming. Not sure if this is normal but again not cool.12. I don't know yet if I want to hassle and buy another phone and send this back, get my money, etc. Even though Amazon seems to do well with returns.13. I wonder if anyone else has this similar dilemma? Did anyone return it, get their money back and bought another Alcatel or something else?14. I hope my review helped someone out there. Go ahead and buy it, but please read some of the other reviews. Seems like some of us got a bad batch? Maybe. Go try your luck. this could have easily been a 3 or solid 4 star. I don't know about a 5 star. I am being honest but I am also picky. I did a lot of homework before getting here and even then I had some doubts. Guess you never know till you have one in your hands. GOOD LUCK YA'LL!","907","Alcatel","2"
"1100","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","I love this phone. I previously had a Galaxy Nexus on T-Mobile that was getting very long in tooth. If you have a phone on T-Mobile that doesn't have LTE, like Nexus 4, just get this phone already. Lots of areas down I-95 in North and South Carolina that don't have HSPA signals, only Edge or LTE. It was annoying my wife. She would be fuming about her slow connection on her Nexus 4, and I'm running a solid LTE signal.The only thing this doesn't have that the Nexus lines have is the wireless charging. This one has NFC for mobile payments or easily connecting Bluetooth devices, plus the addition of the microSD card slot, radio, good stereo speakers (although not the loudest), and a truly all day battery. This is a great value as well for $249.It's a big phone. I have large hands and find it hard to use one-handed. In return you get a huge screen that works well in bright Florida sun. It is surprisingly light though.One thing, without a case, I have large hands but my fingers would frequently touch the screen and cause the phone to do things unintentionally. I got one of the LK Ultra Jelly Series TPU Gel Rubber in clear frosted plastic, and it takes care of that problem. I would have gotten the manufacturers case, but it had sold out.","907","Alcatel","2"
"1101","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","So far I really like it considering the price. I switched from a Galaxy S4. My main love is the pure android feel of the device. SO much better than Samsung's touchwiz. Night and day improvement. Size is large, yet it doesn't seems abnormally large in my pocket. Slim and sleek. Good screen quality. Headphones are nice and a bonus. Mine work fine. Some said theirs don't work? Speakers in phone are great. Battery good. Reception and call quality seem good so far for me. I do seem to have one less bar than my s4 but haven't had connection issues.Cons: Doesn't appear to have a remote controller to control the TV. I liked that about the S4. I'll have to just get over that, but became used to that feature. Camera is ok. Seems about on par with the S4 which wasn't iphone quality but pretty decent unless indoors. Faster focus though. No home button. Instead just double tap the screen. Kind of like that, but it's taking some getting used to. Frequently the double tap lags or doesn't register to wake up device. Kind of annoying. Volume on the right also taking some getting used to. As with all unlocked devices, other than iPhone you can't get WiFi calling and texting on T-Mobile. Hope android fixes that soon.Overall I'd say I'm pleasantly surprised. It's much more enjoyable to use than the S4. I just got it last night so these are my quick observations. I can update more as I use it. The interface on this thing is amazing. More like an iPhone in pleasure and ease to use. Icons are live unlike the S4. Bye touchwiz! For $250 I can't imagine a better option.Update: I'm bumping this up to 5 stars because the more I use this the more I really like it. Was at 4 stars prior. Had some issues with my alarm clock not going off. I think I've fixed the issue now... hopefully. Called tech support today and they answered right away and helped me out. Kudos to Alcatel. Only major annoyance now is that I have to hit the power button to wake up the phone. I'm getting used to it, but not quite as convenient as a home button. The double tap only works 50% of the time so I've given up on it. Overall the interface on this phone is just a pleasure to use.","907","Alcatel","2"

The unorthodox button placement is a PIA to get used to.I can understand the lag issue, with this being a budge device but come on Alcatel.

Now the price is much higher but still well worth it.My other phone is a Motorola G3, third generation, the one that is somewhat waterproof, a unique quality of that phone. I have gone back and forth with these two phones and love both of them, but I always come back to the Alcatel. Since I am a musician I value one quality of this phone that very few phone orders give a hoot about, and that's the sound. The sound produced by the speakers of this phone is truly amazing considering that it is just a cell phone. My Moto G sounds tinny by comparison and my wife has a Moto X Pure and even hers can't begin to compare with the sound of the Alcatel. I also love the unique screen size, 4.7 inches, a nice, small size that is easy to manage and has excellent quality as well.The camera is every bit as capable as the Moto G and overall this phone is a most excellent phone, especially for the price. I would highly recommend this phone, and likely even some cheaper Alcatel phones based on the quality of this one.","907","Alcatel","2"

Minus a white UI or User Interface for noobs all you have to do is install a launcher I'd prefer the Samsung S6 style because it turns the UI 100% transparent for my first phone I am satisfied. There's only one flaw is the guide book strictly tells you not to use it so much to retain its full performance speed and the battery might over heat any way so it's recommended to NOT constantly keep it on.Don't be confused because I told you the battery heats because any battery in a phone can over heat and catch fire, Sadly phones are not build with micro cooling fans which can cool down the device unless you get a phone case that supports a built in cooling fan. I would recommend a grip case though because the phone is slick. Also watch out because the phone screen its self is actually glass which is possibly fragile but has a good quality display that I really like and YES it is HD!If you get this phone make sure you also get a screen protector and I'd recommend a stylist if you're worried about smudge marks it also prevents others from seeing your pin code or drag lock code. The phone also fits with the Homido VR Head Display and can support virtual reality because it has a gyroscope and 360 tracking. I really love watching anime with it and can't wait to get it activated the only issue I had was it did not load youtube repeater that well so any way to end this I will say it's pretty good for a standard phone but if you want more performance go with a 32gb phone or above but for 16gb this phone is worth it and for the price.","907","Alcatel","2"

I spend $25 every 3 months on a AT+T GoPhone account - SIM only - but don't burn data on it . . . I use wifi signals whether I am at home or traveling. In 3 years I have saved $1,800!I've had the phone less than a week, and these are my observations thus far . . .THE GOOD+ Dual-band (2.4GHz / 5GHz) for wifi . . . Netflix is SNAPPY on the 5ghz band of my home router. Downloading huge maps for offline use is also ZIPPY. Disable your data function!+ Adjustable screen brightness+ The cost. I would have liked to have paid less, who wouldn't!, but this phone is a long term investment, and money well spent. If you're on one of the 'big boys' data plans, then the Idol is couch change to you.+ The camera: 13 mp front, and 8 mp rear. Nice quality, and being a photographer I know what I'm talking about. Low light? I saw one review stating that the camera function was poor in low light. Pffft!+ Video: 1080p high def. Gorgeous.+ Accessories: The screen protector, holster and the gel-like skin were all $10 each or less from Amazon.+ Display: 5.5"" is plenty big enough for reading, playing or watching movies.+ Audio: Seriously, the JBL speakers couldn't be better.+ Storage: 16gb, plus if you need it you can add a MicroSD card up to 128gb in size.+ As it's an unlocked GSM phone with a SIM, it can be used globally by purchasing a local SIM when you arrive. I've been doing that for years with my old Android.THE BAD [not really]- Power switch is on the side not the top, so I often adjust the side-mounted volume controls by accident- You can't switch to a fresh battery if need be, but that said I never used the back-up battery with my previous phone.Talking of my previous phone, it was a Chinese Android knock-off - the Star V1277 - so in comparison you're probably thinking that I'm easy to please.You're right, but so will you be if you purchase this phone!","907","Alcatel","2"
"1115","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","4","I bought this phone after having used an iPhone 5 for 2.5 years. I'm no phone expert but I have owned several smart phones including the original Samsung Galaxy, and iPhone 3, and the aforementioned iPhone5. The reason I chose this phone was the specs and the decent price. I paid 250 with a 10% discount from Amazon which reduced it to 225. For an unlocked phone that performs decently that is a good deal. My thoughts about the phone below.The good stuff: The phone itself feels solid. I like the front facing speakers - they provide good sound. The screen is good. It's bright and big and does what it's supposed to do. The back of the phone doesn't feel like plastic, although it probably is. The fact that I still can't tell three weeks into it should tell you all you need to know about that. The size of the phone was a bit daunting when I started using it (iPhone 5 is tiny compared to this phone) but it's grown on me. I can finally read comfortably using a phone. That means I use my tablet less. Finding apps is not a problem. Google apps seem to work just a little bit better on Android, although that shouldn't be a surprise. My wi-fi connectivity works great, and the phone calls I make sound clearer than my old iPhone. The 4G/LTE connectivity seems to work better too although I can't prove it.The bad: The phone is noticeably slow when starting apps. The wait time to start apps is measured in seconds and it's annoying. If you buy this phone, buy the one with 4GB RAM. One nice feature that really helps me is being able to shut down all open applications with one button click something the iPhone never had. Another bad thing are the button locations. The power button and the volume buttons are on opposite sides of the phone at the same level so when I push the button to shut off the screen I end up squeezing both sides of the phone which takes a screen shot. I can't even tell you how many screen shots I've mistakenly taken. Not a huge deal, but again, annoying. I don't particularly like where Android puts all it's system settings, but that's a personal nit since I'm still acclimating to the Android.Bottom line: It's a good unlocked phone at an affordable price.

The screen suddenly started to display stripes and the colors are completely off. Phone was generally good but I did experience the gentle lag that all the reviews refer to. Not a deal-breaker, but noticeable. The issue with the screen did however prompt me to return the phone because I don't have a lot of confidence this phone will hold up based on the sudden change of the screen quality. I've been trying the mid-range, well rated phones of late and had no luck with this one as well as the Asus Zenfone2, so I guess I'll have to continuing searching or suck it up and just get an unlocked iPhone if I want something a little more relaible. I want to love this phone, it's almost there, the headphones are really good, the screen was great before it crapped out, but I just don't want to putz around troubleshooting something I just bought. Better luck next time I hope...","907","Alcatel","2"

The screen is beautiful, the look and feel is very premium, the speakers are the best I've heard on any mobile device, and the software is the perfect blend of stock Android and some very useful customizations (the feature that flips the screen orientation is really cool). Seriously, the speaker is outstanding - music sounds incredible and I now love to use the speakerphone. The ONLY complaints I have about it are that it is sometimes a TAD bit slower than the flagship phones in opening a program or doing a task, and the camera sometimes has grainy images in low light or when you zoom in. But even then, I compared it with other phones, and I'd say the pictures are only 5%-10% more noisy than the best ones, so it's not a big deal. Plus the shutter speed is really fast. And I like that the LED flash is a more yellow color which leads to more natural toned pictures taken with the flash.The button placement, as people have mentioned, is a little weird, but it is not a big deal and you get used to it quickly.","907","Alcatel","2"

I've had it for week now and it does everything I want.The phone, Billy, showed up within 24 hours of being ordered - one of the perks of Amazon Prime. It arrived in great condition.I use Billy on a T-Mobile pay-as-you go plan and the T-Mobile store was able to transfer my contacts over from my old Blackberry phone. They were also able to cut down my large size SIM card to fit the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 small SIM card format. They also fit in my old 8GB memory card without trouble. They said the passcode had to be turned off to transfer the contacts and this phone does not allow the passcode to be turned off, but they were able to transfer everything over OK.To make full use of the features of this phone I had to create a free Google account, which was no big deal. It is not required to use the phone, but it makes it easier to use the built in Google apps.The text messaging interface works nicely and seems to be adapting to my style and word choice. It suggests the next word and is getting better and better and predicting what I am trying to say which makes texting faster.The camera takes amazing pictures with crystal clarity. I'm really impressed with the quality of pictures it takes. Speaking of clarity, I've watched a couple of YouTube videos on it and I was blown away. The resolution and crispness of the colors is better than my television and the sound it fantastic.I also got a FitBit and I really enjoy monitoring my progress on this phone.The battery lasts me throughout the day although the battery is low by the end on the day. My old Blackberry would last for 3 days before it needed a charge, although I would charge it every night. But to be fair, with all the increased features on this phone, I'm using Billy a lot more. It is also much bigger than my old phone. I used to wear my old phone on a holster on my belt, but that doesn't seem practical with a phone of this size. It generally fits in my deeper trouser pockets OK.Overall a great phone and I really love it.","907","Alcatel","2"

Great display even in sunlight. Loud audio. Really cool software features. Pretty fast. Noticed a little stutter when downloading a web page with multiple embedded mixed media. Did not try any games on it. Double tap sleep was great. Double tap wake worked <50% of the time. Minimal bloatware. A pleasure to use!The problem: Using this on T-mobile, I could not get a good enough signal in my house to make or receive calls and texts. Figured that it wasn't a carrier issue since my kids (in same house with same carrier) had no issues with cell reception on their Moto X (2013) and Samsung Galaxy S5. It wasn't a SIM card issue, I put it in my 9.7 inch Chinese phone tablet that wasn't meant to be used in the U.S. and I was able to get a strong, consistent 3G signal and make calls from it with good clarity. My phone seemed locked to finding an LTE signal, and instead of dropping to 3G or 2G connections, it would simply not connect at all. Through 95% of the house I would get No signal or Emergency calls only mode. If I changed settings to 3G only or 2G only I could sometimes get a good signal for a while, but then it would suddenly disappear even when the phone isn't moved (sitting on the table). I lost signal completely at a local Subway, at my doctor's office, and had a call cutoff a couple times while sitting at a mall parking lot. I need my kids to be able to reach me at all times in case of emergency.Signal strength on this phone throughout my house would be about -125dBm and 99 asu while on LTE or no signal at all. I got a Samsung Galaxy S4 on sale for $299 and was able to connect consistently throughout the house. It's LTE signal strength was about -115 dBm and 35 asu, so the Idol 3 was about -10 dBm worse and hence no calls. Right now the S4 switched down to HSPA with -105 dBm and 4 asu. The Idol 3 would never switch down, just lose connection. Not sure if that is a problem with my specific phone or a general software issue. The Galaxy S4 can also make wifi calls, so I kept the S4 and returned the Idol 3.I had great connectivity on the Idol 3 at work and in an adjacent city, so if you live in an area with good coverage and won't venture out of the area much, then this phone may work great for you.While sorting through this issue, Alcatel was very responsive to my emails, so +1 to the seller. I hope their next phone has a better antenna and is wifi-enabled for calls, because I really liked this device. I really wanted it to work for me, but bottom line, the best phone for me is one that can keep a connection with my carrier in my area so that I can make and receive calls and texts. A phone that can't make calls is useless to me.For those of you who have great reception, you've got a good device at a great price!","907","Alcatel","2"
"1125","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","3","So much for the joys of unlocked phones. Regardless whether I let Android automatically detect network or I manually choose any of the 3 discovered MetroPcs networks, I receive error the ""SIM Card Not Permitted to Connect"" to network. Went to YouTube and created a few custom APNs to no avail. Alcatel .pdf says all you need to do is plop in the SIM, your micro flash and let Android do the rest. 250 dollar brick at the moment. Returned the SIM back to the old phone and all is well. Not the experience I expected, having read the Alcatel guide online.**Update: Replacement phone has no Chinese-language error messages. That was first hint that initial phone had some unusual problem. Amazon returns are very easy and as soon as box was in UPS queue the refund was issued (same day). Metro would not associate phone ID with network without purchase of a new $26 dollar SIM card from the store. I would think an active SIM from previous device associated with new device should work, but I would be mistaken. That's how they roll, apparently. Their rationale is that stolen phones on their network are their bane and this procedure makes their lives easier by associating one phone per card--whatever. How nice for them. Folks at company-owned store were polite and efficient about it, though. Phone, itself, is pretty good. If the ""Recent Apps"" screen had no esoteric animation, there would be no performance lags to report. Launching and switching between apps is quick. Great media device. Handles everything I throw at it with ease. While the Sony hardware is so-so, it looks like the preloaded software isn't the best, either. Swap out the installed Camera app with after-market one and the reported camera deficiencies are improved, even in lower light. For $250 bucks it's hard to beat for average use.

"1129","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","Summary:Just an amazing phone for any price range.I have been using my Idol 3 for about 4 days now and I must say I am loving everything about it. People all over the net keep talking about just how great the screen and speakers are. I can't stress this enough they are both truly amazing. I am coming from the OnePlus One and although on paper the OPO has slightly better specs all around. I think that Alcatel did a much better job of implementing android more so then CM did. I stress this because basic functionality just operates so much smoother. For example typing. Typing just about anywhere whether it be writing an email or texting or whatever, is just extremely responsive. After having used my OPO for almost a year I had gotten used to having to type a little slow. On the IDOL 3 I can speed type again which means I can get more work emails done faster this I love! I don't see to many people talk about this fact but the screen is very responsive as well as it is bright. This is also my first phone with front facing speakers. All I can say is wow what a difference that makes. I watch a lot of videos on my phone and it does really enhance the experience all around. The phone itself is actually smaller than the OPO as well as it is thinner. It feels very sturdy and portable I put a screen protector and case on my and it is still very pocketable. Also a lot of people are asking about updates. Well I too am a little concerned about updates. However right out of the box I received one OTA update of around 50mb which I installed right away. Every now and then you see a little lag if you are a heavy multi tasker like I am. But I feel confident that this is related to crappy lollipop 5.0.2 and that once this guy gets the latest 5.1.1 those issues should be all smoothed out as 5.1.1 is know to perform quite a bit better and isnt supposed to have the memory leaks found in 5.0.1. My only other is the double tap to wake. This feature works here and there and isnt very reliable. I am sure they could fix this in a software update.","907","Alcatel","2"

It's pretty close to stock Android with some minor tweaks to the UI - which I didn't mind. Battery life was pretty good (I could go a couple days with medium usage). The screen is crisp and bright. Sounds were loud and clear. And that brings me to a minor issue I had with the ringer and notification volumes: At the lowest level they were a bit too loud. Call quality and data speeds were great. I did experience occasional sluggishness when opening and switching between apps. As I used it for a couple of days, I struggled to get used to the power button on the left and the volume rocker on the right (it's completely opposite of the Nexus 4). This, combined with the larger size made it awkward to turn on/off and adjust volumes. I thought I would enjoy a larger device with the 5.5"" screen, but I just couldn't get used to it. Perhaps, if I kept using it, I would eventually get used to it. But why compromise? I'd rather buy a device and love it from the get go. Welcome back Nexus 4! For me, I think the 4.7"" screen is the perfect size. I still recommend this phone.","907","Alcatel","2"

I have been playing with it for the last two days and below are my impressions .Pros : the biggest one is how much device you are getting for your money , this phone has a large 5.5 inch 1080p display , JBL tuned front firing stereo speakers that sound great , a 3000maH battery , heck it even comes with rather nice JBL earbuds in a nice package , these are specs you will find on devices that cost much more from other well known brands . the build quality is just fine , the phone feels nice in the hands , the software is well done with Android Lollipop running almost stock with very little customization done from Alcatel and not much bloatware. the display has rather accurate colors and looks sharp just like any other flagship device , the 13 Mp main camera is not the best in the business but pictures look sharp in well lit places and okay for low light ones . the front facing camera is just okay as well . you can perform almost all tasks on this phone without any slowness for the most part (see cons ) and this is where I should get in to the cons .Cons: so what is the catch , I mean there has to be one for a device that costs less then half the amount of a flagship device from other Major brands , well for one thing the Octa Core Qualcom 615 processor used in this phone might sound mighty on paper but the fact is that it is an outdated processor by today's standards , although it performs most tasks just fine , you will find stutter and slowness while browsing the web in the browser and in some apps , it is also not the best device for gaming . the battery specs also look great on paper but so far I have been rather underwhelmed by it with Lg G2 outlasting this phones battery by hours , I hope that the battery will get better with a few more charge cycles . overall all though it is a fantastic device for very little money , if you watch youtube , movies or listen to lots of music on your phone then you will love the front facing speakers , just do not expect this device to be as fast as the $700 phones out today and you will be just fine .","907","Alcatel","2"

Had bring your own device family plan insurance through AT&T(needed it on phone purchased via Next). The claim with Asurion was a HOT mess. This phone was not on their ""list"" of devices and they really don't have any infrastructure for a non flagship phone. Their replacement of like quality was an LG G Flex 2. They charged a tier 3($200) deductible and had no way to appeal that decision. Seriously, 71% deductible. AT&T and Asurion played hot potato about the $200 deductible and I ended up filing Dept of Insurance and FTC complaints.So, long story short either assume the risk and don't get insurance on this phone or insure it via anyone but Asurion.

"1139","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","Throughout my lifetime, the prices on consumer electronics have dropped steadily as capability and quality rises. Smartphones have been an exception, largely because of the subsidy model, and something that acts as a good quality tablet but with data connection and the ability to make phone calls could easily run you close to $800. That puts this Alcatel Onetouch clearly in the budget category, despite being more expensive than a tablet or moderate sized television.These days many carriers are moving away from the subsidy model, and those who are looking for less expensive phones were stuck with ones that were far less capable. Alcatel has changed that with this phone. While it won't compete with the latest high end models on today's market, it has power and capability that even high end phones lacked even a few years ago. This ""unlocked"" phone is technically a non-locked phone. It's not loaded with a slew of apps from a specific provider and even lets you get rid of some default apps that you may not want. An important thing for any device not tied to any specific carrier is compatibility. This phone covers all the bands needed for carriers such as AT&T or T-Mobile or any other that uses a SIM, and that includes 4G and LTE bands.It gives you 16GB of memory, with about 10GB available for user content. It also supports a microSD card, for up to 128GB more. It takes a micro SIM, which is fairly standard these days. It gives you a fast Octa-Core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor, which I found responsive. I haven't tested it with video games that are extremely CPU or graphically intensive, but for typical tasks there should be no lag. You get very good sound for built in speakers, and the phone works just as well when you flip it over, even for phone calls.The cameras are very good resolution for an inexpensive phone, and are better than what even high end ones had a few years ago. But you don't get any special frills or controls for exposure. You get a good 13MP camera and an 8MP front facing camera, both of which beat what you find on other inexpensive phones, and both can rival cameras on better phones for outdoor daylight photos. For low light situations, you will get adequate pictures but not at the level of high end devices. You also get 1080p video. One of the big advantages of the video button is that it starts taking video and stops taking video. On other cameras, it will switch you to video mode, but why? All that accomplishes is letting you share the shutter button, which offers little value and is especially awkward if you want to take landscape videos. With this phone, the video button is in a logical place for landscape video, there's no reason to switch modes, and your shutter button still works for still photos. That way you can take video much faster without waiting to switch modes, and the button will work for those holdouts who still insist on vertical videos.I haven't torture tested it, but the glass is supposed to be highly scratch resistant and more breakage resistant than for typical phones. The phone itself doesn't have the look or feel of a cheap phone. Phone screens have been growing larger, and this one gives you a 5.5 inch screen. Personally I could make do with a smaller screen, but companies make phones with smaller screens that sacrifice capability in many other ways and Alcatel is no exception.A few things I don't like about the phone are that the battery isn't removable. That might not be a long term problem since battery life is pretty good. I also don't like the offset USB connector on the bottom since it makes it awkward to use the built in cradle in my car. This is a disadvantage compared to what works well for companies such as Samsung or Apple. The other thing that's apparently missing is WiFi calling for T-Mobile. Google now has a Hangouts dialer, which can accomplish the same thing and aside from caller ID not pointing to your primary number that could be a workaround.Other issues have to do with support. The phone has been out long enough now that the company should have phone-specific support information on its website, but it's still not there. This phone doesn't show up on the list on the support page. That means there are no downloads or phone specific FAQs. The phone comes with a Quick Start Guide, but no user manual and there's none on the website.UPDATE: There is still no link to a user manual on their website, but customer service was able to send me a URL for one. There are some features that need further explanation and I was hoping that the user manual would cover them. For example, the status LED doesn't work like the one on other phones or have colors to indicate anything. The phone has a setting to turn it on or off. You'd expect the manual to tell you what the LED indicates, but all the manual says about that setting is ""Touch to turn on/off the LED indicator."" If you want to know how the time lapse feature for the camera works, the manual says ""Touch to enable Time-lapse"" when describing the setting, but that's already obvious.Overall, you get a lot for your money. It may not be the highest end phone out there, but the big companies better look over their shoulders. It beats what they offer at this price point and I wouldn't be surprised if this company has something that is truly competitive with the competition's top of the line in the near future.","907","Alcatel","2"

These are what I've experienced during my usage.I bought this phone because my brother's iPhone 4s was too slow and too small. He already used an Android device, but he feels more comfortable on iOS.Pros1. Thin and lightweight design (not my kind of thing, but most people would like it)2. Great display (almost rivals the $389 OnePlus 2, which is my daily driver)3. Loud speakers (louder than the Galaxy S6, the LG G4, and the OnePlus 2, but not as loud as the HTC One M9, the Moto X Pure Edition, and the Nexus 6P)4. Nice battery life (better than the Galaxy S6, but not as good as the Nexus 6P)5. Clean UI (uninstallable bloatware, stock Android-like interface)Cons1. Average performance (1.5GHz octa-core S615, 2GB RAM is not as good as the Asus Zenfone 2 and the OnePlus X)2. Average rear-facing camera (colors are dull, focus is slow)3. Charging speed (2 and 1/10 hours)4. Bloatware (even though it can be uninstalled, it'd be nice if it just didn't come with it)5. Not durable enough (doesn't feel robust and dependable)6. Price (it needs to be $200)So, it's an overall okay phone for the price, but I would go with the Zenfone 2 or the OnePlus X. Also, for $199.99, the Honor 5X has very similar specs to the Idol 3 5.5"". So, I wouldn't fault you if you just bought one, but you can do better.","907","Alcatel","2"

After 5 months of use I can say definitely say that this phone is a huge disappointment.The Idol 3 has a nice big 1080p display which looks great, 2 GB of RAM, a decent processor, slim sleek design, and a mostly bloat-free stock Android OS. Unfortunately, the software is horribly unoptimized because this phone suffers from lots of performance issues. Lag when watching videos on YouTube, blurry pictures with the camera, and apps taking ages to open up are some examples.I had my phone bricked when trying to take a system update so I set up a warranty repair on their website and overnighted my phone to Alcatel. Only to have it returned to me 3 days later unrepaired because my phone had ""water damage"". My phone has been in a case since day 1 and has never been submerged in or splashed with water. Clearly they don't want to honor their warranty.Pair that with the fact that this phone rarely gets patches and will likely never be updated to Android 6.0 and I recommend paying a little more for a Galaxy, LG, or Nexus phone.","907","Alcatel","2"

The LCD display is amazing for what it is. No 4k was not a deal breaker for me 1080p is more than enough. I've dropped it at least 20 times and there is not even a scratch. EvoCel case.

The screen is just fantastic and the speakers are amazing. It absolutely blows away my Moto X 2014 in that regard. The processor is OK, there's a bit of lag here and there but it's not overwhelming and something you can easily live with. The battery life seemed to be really fantastic, and it was a mostly great device.I only ran into problems when it comes to using it as a phone. Calls sound muddy, and everyone who I spoke to had issues understanding me. Coming from my Moto X, which had fantastic call quality, this was very disappointing. Using the phone in speakerphone mode didn't help at all, if anything, it made it worse! I've also noticed it struggled with signal strength in the same areas where the X had no issue, consistently pulling a signal that was anywhere between 5-7 dBm worse than the X.Maybe I got a bad device, but in reading more reviews I've noticed that muffled calls and signal issues seem to be commonplace. Honestly, a slightly better microphone and antenna would make this a killer phone. If your goal is to use the browser and apps, you'll be fine with this phone. If you plan on anything more than occasional call, I'd look for something else.","907","Alcatel","2"

Pre update this phone was 4 stars tops. Post update it's a 5. You may have noticed other reviews knock the double tap feature. That's been completely fixed. The camera is better and lag is nearly non existent.Pros1) the front speakers are as good as advertised - I've tested them with my HTC m8 and they are easily on par with boomsound (without the infamous bezel).2) battery life is insanely good3) screen quality and brightness is top notch4) I LOVE the reversible screen. It's not a gimmick and actually is useful, especially when I have a headphone jack plugged in. I can now decide if I want the headphones jack to be on the bottom or the top.5) SD expansion. Enough said.6) near stock Android. I don't feel the need to add a launcher like I did with previous Samsung phones (s4, s5)7) cool features like a compass and fm radioCons1) music tends hiccup every now and then. Doesn't matter which player I'm using or how I'm listening (headphones or directly through the speakers). Was hoping that the update would fix but it didn't. Hopefully a future update will.2) no IR. I get it, it's a $250 phone so this is nitpicking honestly3) wish the battery was removable. This used to be a deal breaker for me but it seems to be the trend nowadays. Learning to deal.The camera is neither a pro or a con for me. It's not as good as the s6, g4 or even the s5. But it is as good or better than the m8 (don't know about the m9). It isn't bad by any stretch... Especially outdoors. (Sony lens).Bottom line is I love this phone. I'm sold and simply can't justify $700 or $800 for other flagships nor can I justify subsidizing or anything like that any longer. The idol 3, zenphone and moto g seem to be setting a trend in the smartphone world and it's exciting stuff.

The Nexus 4 is my previous phone. There are many review articles and videos online about the Idol 3. Each stating about the same thing. Good enough but not great processing power. Good but not great camera. Close to stock Android. Big, bright and clear display. Poor button placement. I just wanted to comment on the many reviews that say the buttons are too high. I think the designers took into account that this smartphone will be handled by two hands by most people. Holding it in your left hand and using your right to navigate positions the buttons perfectly. Your left thumb is on the power with the left index on the volume. So people who buy this phone knowing to use two hands and they want value for their dollar... They'll find it difficult to beat this one. I for one am very happy with the product so far.","907","Alcatel","2"

The Idol 3 is not a high-end smartphone like the samsung galaxy s6 or the lg g4, but it does deliver some pretty good performances and specs for the average user and you get this phone for around 1/3 the price. The camera is good but not for professional phototagraphers. The display is a full hd ips display and can be very birght. The phone is made of plastic but it has a nice brushed finish which makes it look premium. The Duel Front facing speakers are loud and clear. Now the reason I gave this product a 4 star is the performances and experiences I had recently. The double tap feature is sometimes laggy and sometimes I have to double tap multiple times to get the phone open. When I go on a heavy website on the web browser, I can barely scroll the screen. We will see an update for this phone however, and hopefully these issues will be resolved. In conclusion get this phone and stop thinking about those high end smartphones.","907","Alcatel","2"
"1166","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","1","I have never been as disappointed with an item from Amazon as I am with this one.First, some good points about the phone. The display and audio are top notch. Not even by grading on the curve of a $250 phone, they were as good or better than just about any flagship I've had. As good or better than any other display I've seen, and the front facing stereo speakers were amazing. No question about it. The phone performed fairly well, just a little bit slower than my 2013 LG Optimus G Pro, which had the same basic specs as this unit. The almost stock Android Lollipop was a nice thing to have, not much bloatware had to be removed. I changed the phone's supplied launcher to the Google Launcher and that gave the unit even more of a stock Android feel.I should have known I was in for a nightmare when I opened the phone and found that Alcatel didn't include the tool that's needed to pop out the SIM and SD card tray. It took a couple of hours to find something small enough to fit into the tiny hole that releases the tray, and since the phone arrived on a Saturday, Alcatel tech support was closed and Amazon was no help, offering to send a replacement phone that might arrive Monday, but most likely would come Tuesday. Glad I pay for Amazon Prime to get such speedy service when a product is defective. But I finally got the tray open and was able to insert the SIM and SD cards from my current phone. Turned the phone on and it immediately found AT&T, provisioned itself smoothly, and I thought I was off to the races. Boy, was I wrong.I spent almost two days migrating apps from my old phone to this one, arranging the icons on the screen where I wanted them (this phone only allowed 4 icons in a row while the LG had 5, so the NFC setup process couldn't replicate my current screen arrangement) and re-entering login and other information for all my apps. I have a fair amount of apps, so it took a while. In order to clean the cache and speed up the phone a bit after everything was ""just so"", I restarted the phone, something I've done with the ten or so other Android phones I've had over the years. When the phone came back up, I noticed that about a third of the app icons were gone from my home screens. Just gone. And when I tried to open a couple of other apps, I got a message on the bottom of the screen that the app wasn't installed.I know Android can do some funky things, so I waited about ten minutes to see if the information would show up on the screen and it hadn't changed, so I rebooted the phone again. When it came on, even MORE icons were missing from the home screens. I could find most (not all) of the missing apps in the app drawer and could launch about half of them. But some of the data was gone, with very little chance of getting it back. And since I lost more data the second time I restarted the phone, I wasn't really interested in restarting again and losing even more data.So the two days I spent getting the phone loaded up were blown the second I tried to restart it. I hardly call that a small bug, and looking around some developer forums, it doesn't seem to be a bug tied to Android 5.0.2, which is what the phone is running with an Alcatel layer over it. So it's either the Alcatel modifications or a hardware issue causing the problem. Either way, that kind of performance is completely unacceptable, and while I think the phone has some good parts to it and the price is right, if it's going to lose data, I can't trust it or continue to use it. Even my kid's $99 BLU phone is more stable than this device is.So back to Amazon it goes, along with the accessories that were supposed to arrive on Sunday but didn't come because Amazon made a deal with the Devil when they chose the USPS to handle its Sunday deliveries. All in all, about a $300 lesson that sometimes you get what you pay for, and in this case I got a useless, low quality phone on the inside that looks like a great phone on the outside.Oh, and one more thing. Amazon chose to ship the phone via USPS in a padded envelope, not a box. I found the envelope with the phone in it jammed in my mailbox with all my other mail, making for a very tight squeeze to get the envelope out of the mailbox without tearing it. So the phone had less protection than it probably should have had and went through the postal system, which could have led to some kind of a hardware defect. I'm not going to try my luck with another phone, especially if Amazon is going to use such an insecure way to ship the phone. I bet they don't ship S6's in envelopes. Just sayin'.Next time, I'll spend a little more money and get a phone I can trust.","907","Alcatel","2"

"1168","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","The Idol 3 has been provided an amazing experience for me at a third of the cost of some of the top-tier phones available on the market. At $250 this smartphone provides all of the functionality I would want from a daily driver and there are only a few nit-picky features (a better camera, ir blaster, wireless charging and dedicated shutter button) missing that I would need to have to ""upgrade"" away from this phone. The previous phones I have used in order are the Galaxy Note II, Moto X, and the Sharp Aquos Crystal and this phone blows them all out the water.Design and Size:Simply put, this phone feels great in the hand. The symmetrical design and lack of capacitive keys really make the phone seem much smaller than other phones of the same screen size. At 5.5"" this phone is relatively easy to use one-handed (and I have average to small-sized hands for a guy). It is also as light or lighter than my previous phones. It does not have ""premium build quality"" with metals or glass, but personally that has never mattered to me. Besides the customization of designing my Moto X nothing really stood out as ""me"" when looking to purchase other phones. But besides all that, the phone looks great. The brushed metal look works for me, and since it is plastic it works for my wallet as well. I have never had an issue with dropping this phone or it feeling awkward to use.Screen:This screen is great. It is 1080p, videos play well, colors pop, and I can take it out in the middle of the day and actually see the screen in direct sunlight. The size of the screen also makes reading text easier and videos feel immersive. It doesn't quite live up to the borderless Aquos Crystal experience, but there is no light leakage on this screen and it does better at an angle. Also, the screen responds well to the touch, even with a tempered-glass protective covering over it. That is something that cannot be said with the Sharp Aquos Crystal.Sound:I never realized how much having the front-facing speakers would improve the quality of gaming and video experiences. Being able to lay down the phone and watch a video without the output sounding muffled or indistiguishable from gibberish is awesome. I find myself watching videos on my phone more than ever because of the audio features. Additionally, the included JBL earbuds are a nice touch and the JBL Mix audio app is one of the coolest I have ever used. I honestly find myself making playlists just to work on my mixing and transitions between tracks. Just check out some videos on youtube to see the app for itself because honestly a description here won't do justice to how fun the app is.Operating System and features:Comes out of the box with lollipop and just updated to version 5.0.2 today. As with any android phone customization is really limitless so I won't spend time on that here. The reversible feature is pretty neat, and merits me echoing other reviews. If it was not for the button placement or the design of my screen protector there would be times when I pull my phone out of my pocket and have no idea it was upside-down. The fluidity with how it works really stands out for functionality, and I am suprized this has not been a feature in phones prior to the Idol 3.Battery Life:There are phones that will get you longer battery life, but I have never been able to kill my phone in just one day of daily use. I am not implying that it will be at 30% when you wake up the next day, but it is definitely an upgrade over my first gen Moto X. Not having to find a charger immediately when I get home from work provides a little more freedom to the daily grind. I know that usage varies by person, but outside of gamers I don't think moderate to light users will have too many gripes about battery life.Conclusion:Buy this phone. If you want a great experience at a great price, buy this phone. One of my best decisions in a while to take the plunge. Being an unlocked phone carrying no carrier bloatware and built in apps like Mix, File Explorer and Wifi Display actually adding to the experience, Im starting to see less and less reason to ever sign up for a carrier contract again. If you need financing options, there is an Amazon store card for that. At $250 though, you won't find yourself in much of a financial bind if you decide to pick one up.","907","Alcatel","2"

Although it was used. It preforms well but my package didn't come with the jbl headphone, just apple headphones. As for most users, battery is a main concern. My idol 3 gets about four to five hours of screen one time. I would like to state I am a heavy battery user. Bluetooth enabled most of time for my moto 360 and Bluetooth devices. Data also enabled for couple hours. For my opinion, this is an average phone, battery wise. Buy a fast charger for this phone as it only comes with a standard alcatel charger. The NFC and the Gyroscope sensor work very well for VR streaming. On board speakers are greatly better than most phones due to the dual front facing features. The camera is just good. Nothing to write home about. I highly advise y'all to buy the ""A better camera unlocked"" app. There is also a free version if y'all are into that. The app will make the camera in par with the iPhone cameras. If y'all are wondering about the double tap to wake feature. I'd like to say it works but only with the one touch launcher. It might just be a software issue with the marshmallow upfate. Hope alcatel fixes it soon. As of now. I use nova launcher with the knock lock app and the gravity lock app. Works well in unison.Overall. Great phone for the $200 mark. I did get mine used and for cheaper the price. Nothing bad.

This phone froze all of the time, not only did I experience the stutter others experienced, but it froze and it crashed often. At first I thought it was my fault, so I cleared all of my cache, deleted useless folders, downloaded cleaner apps etc. but nothing worked, the phone kept freezing, crashing, and rebooting itself when I was in the middle of things. I've had this phone about two weeks now and I've had it. In a rage, I twisted the phone in my hands until I had shattered the LCD, screen and mangled the housing. It felt awesome. All in all, I should have known better this phone was released in 2014 and we're living in 2016. Two years in the tech industry is a lifetime... don't make the mistake I made. If you hate freezing, unresponsive, garbage cell phones, DON'T buy this product.","907","Alcatel","2"

I have had it over a month now and it receives excellent coverage for T-Mobile on the Dallas and Austin Texas areas. The phone is very light and feels very nice to hold. The speakers are excellent and the headphones sound amazing but I have trouble keeping them in my ears even after changing the earbud inserts. Phone streams MLB.TV on the LTE network with no issues which was one of the main things I was hoping for. Battery life is excellent, I am not a hardcore phone user but it lasts me 2 days without charging which includes the mlb app, clash of clans, and facebook/google hangouts messaging. If you are looking for a new phone and not wanting to spend a fortune this phone is perfect choice. I have had no latency issues with the 5.0 Android build with it like I read. The screen is very vibrant and looks amazing.Cons: Like to pocket dial a lot but I heard Android is famous for that with emergency calling. No Camera button on the sides, I was very accustomed to it on my Nokia Lumia 925. Only 2 pages for shortcuts to apps, not sure if that is able to be changed or not. The double tap screen isn't as responsive as my wife's Sony Xperia. But I can live with those cons.I am not an Android fan boy and this is my first Android phone I converted from a Windows phone (Which I also loved.) I have to say all in all I would highly recommend this phone.","907","Alcatel","2"

I like the camera, I have no problem using this instead of my ""real"" camera in most cases. Being unlocked is a must for me now.I would definitely recommend this phone.

I admit that I am a fairly light user, and mainly use it as a phone. I can go at least 4-5 days between charges, honestly up to a week....Reception is better than my previous phones (Samsung & Sony phones) and wifi strength is comparable. There had been some camera issues (the main one for me being battery drain) but that's been improved. The ""tap to turn on"" feature works reliably now, the screen is beautiful, and it's fast with web and google play store browsing.The button locations may be a problem for some, but I find I use it upside down just as much as right side up. Since always use my phone left handed because I am doing something else (like writing or unlocking a door) with my dominant hand, it's nice to have those buttons where they are.... My hands are pretty small but dexterous so a little ""shimmy"" is not a problem given my case.I have only dropped it once-- it has no chips or scratches.Could not be more pleased at this point, but I don't think that my use is typical.

This probably means that the back cover has gotten loose somehow. I have never dropped the phone, nor do I use it roughly. I am very gentle with it, and only after 1 month of use (the other month was spent on a trip), the back is already loose. I am very disappointed and the return period is already over.I was very hopeful for this smartphone, but it seems that there is a reason why higher end phones are priced the way they are.","907","Alcatel","2"

It handles everything I ask of it; combinations of texting, phone calls, Youtube, GPS, streaming video and audio services. I've read that the phone can bog down when you multitask too much with it, but I haven't noticed this with my usage. I use this phone which Cricket Wireless (which I would also recommend).Pros:-Screen is great (in brightness and picture quality).-Battery lasts the day unless I do really push it.-Speakers are crisp and decently loud.-The phone is responsive in processing tasks.-The rear camera takes decent pictures under any conditions I've tried.-The cost.Cons-Call quality could be a little better (this may be Cricket's fault) but the quality is good enough to not be an issue.-I wish the speakers were louder; I can't hear audio if I leave the phone on outside of the shower. I realize this is a pretty needy desire that I have.-The stock texting app is pretty terrible. I didn't use it long because one of its ""features"" is to set the date of all group texts to someday in 1970 which causes the message to auto sort to the bottom of the inbox list. Fortunately the Google Messaging app is free and a good replacement.-Bloatware. There isn't a ton of it relative to other phones but it still drives me crazy that I can't delete apps such as the aforementioned terrible texting app.-The screen seems overly sensitive (i.e. often selecting links as I try to scroll through a webpage). However, this may be due to my screen protector. However, I do find it very easy to click small links or buttons accurately.-The front camera isn't the best, but selfies are for nerds.Overall, I can't recommend this phone enough. I can't see a reason to spend more on a different phone. Most of my complaints were easily resolved or not that problematic. I will absolutely look at whatever the latest Alcatel offering is in a few years when it is time for a new phone.","907","Alcatel","2"

A few weeks ago my oneplus one had started to have some issues and I wasn't able to fix it... so I started looking for a new phone. I bought the moto x pure.... it was ok but for the price it wasn't as nice as my oneplus one and I also didn't like how flimsy the buttons were.. so I returned that and tried the blu life one XL which was supposed to be decent (I've had a blu phone in the past and liked it)... I tried it and it was sooo slow.. so that went back. After researching I was torn between the idol3 and the zenfone2... both have great reviews. I chose the idol because of the speakers on front and I'm glad I did. The phone feels great in the hand. Call quality so far is good even in my house and the speakers sound great. The screen is clear (I would suggest pushing the display brightness up a bit) and the reverse call feature is pretty cool. (You can set a feature to have the phone screen to rotate no matter how you are holding it) The only thing that I don't like is the power button is hard to reach and I have long fingers.","907","Alcatel","2"

I read multiple reviews on different phones, and This one is the best buy for its buck. the 4.7 inch screen is Okay, if you have the money go buy that one, but if you have the extra money, just buy this one.

It definitely is a great phone, but does have some shortfalls. The phone is well built and although made of plastic, does feel like a very good solid build - almost as solid as an Iphone, without the weight. Screen is good, although I tend to keep my brightness at 60% to get a comparable display to my iphone. The colors are not as luch as my iphone - a tad washed out but after a while you dont even notice. the sound of the external speakers is amazing! I love it. the sound of the phone with headphones/earphones, both good quality and the ones it came with it, is good - but very low - no matter what app i use to watch videos/hear music, i find it to be a little low for my taste. The vanilla OS is awesome, but after installing just a few apps and 2 months use, the phone now feels very sluggish and and slow.. I find myself constantly having to clean my ram etc. For the price point, its OK.. I think it should cost a little lower considering other phones out there in the under $200 range which easily outperform this device. my true love and reason for buying this phone is the thickness and feel of it... besides that, didnt fine much special about it. Also, my phone appeard to be a 're-pack' as the box was not sealed, and my headphones were defective. I called Alcatel support for an exchange on the headphones and they were very nice and said they will simply send me out a new pair. That was two months ago, i never got anything. I still have to call them again. sux i have to chase them down for something I purchased (supposedly) brand new. the 3 stars however are for the phone, and have nothing to do with the headphone/used phone experience.","907","Alcatel","2"

I was in a desperate state after my previous phone was forced to update to Lollipop after several years of running flawlessly. Unfortunately, Lollipop did not agree with my phone and within an hour I had a nonfunctioning brick. The Alcatel ONETOUCH is by far the best phone I've had and really saved my bacon because my other option was a $600+ phone that I really couldn't afford. Yes, I will admit it takes some getting use to. It's touchy, so when searching on the internet you can accidentally open multiple pages when scrolling, within a few days I was able to figure out the sweet spot on the screen to get around this problem. The sound quality is good which is a problem I read other people had. Picture quality is awesome so far. I've only had the phone for a few months so it's not like I've been in many situations to test the camera's limits, but for day to day use it's pretty solid. When I took this phone to get a new SIM card the tech guy raved on and on about how great the specs are and how it's such a great deal. I can't really speak for that because I have no idea what the specs are in comparison to others. He fiddled with it for a few minutes and in that time 3 people who were trying to get new phones left to order this one. It really is the best deal out there. I was slightly worried about how it would respond to my network (t-mobile) but it runs perfectly. I have no complaints and have recommended it to everyone I know.

"1204","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","Let me start by clarifying the title. While this device may not match up to the current flagships on the market, keep in mind that this is last year's model. Going from an LG G4 to this phone, the only noticeable downgrade was the camera and the non removable battery. That being said, the camera is still better than all of my older flagships except that one, and while the battery isn't replaceable, it still outlasts what my G4 would with the same usage. I sell phones for a living and as a bit of a phone enthusiast, I've used every major brand of phone either for personal use or I've set them up or performed troubleshooting for customers. Alcatel is a brand that I've seen very hit or miss devices come from, so I was a bit leary buying one. I have to say I don't regret it one bit. At the new price of $99 it's a no brainer. If you're looking for a phone that gets stuff done for under $200, this is it. The sound is fantastic, the processor is very snappy even though it's not the very top of the line snapdragon. The phone's design is brilliant and it looks and feels great. There is no real bloatware other than all of the Google apps, and the launcher is clean and very close to pure android. As with any phone, don't forget protection. It will last for you as long as you don't abuse it, and Alcatel does stand behind their warranty so if it does happen to malfunction they will fix it. This phone is what I've been waiting years for. You can't get a better phone at this price point.","907","Alcatel","2"

I took it into a local repair shop and after three weeks they gave it back to me and refunded all charges, telling me that it must be a software issue, because the battery and charging ports work fine.

"1217","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","Hello! After around 6 full months of owning this phone, I'd like to share my 2 cents.I bought this back in October and I am an AT&T costumer. It was a simple process of transferring my SIM card form my previous (much older smartphone) to this new Alcatel Idol 3. I had bought a 64gb memory card to go along with it and again, the installation was super simple and really easy. Both the SIM and memory card sit side-by-side like buddies in a tray that pops in and out of the phone using a thin wire -- such as a paperclip.Anyway, down to the phone itself. I love it. It has met and exceeded my needs and I've used it A LOT in these six months. Like a lot a lot. Everyday for a few hours at least. I do everything from playing games on it, surfing the web, playing videos (lots of youtube!), playing music, reading articles, and of course, calling and texting -- because it's a phone.Here is what I absolutely LOVE about this phone:- The screen. Oh boy the screen. This thing has a beautiful, incredibly BRIGHT screen. I actually have it on the lowest brightness setting, because anything higher than that it is too bright haha. It's really a gorgeous screen. Full HD, 401ppi. Looks great. Again, can get VERY bright.- The RAM and processor. The combination of these two have met my needs with hardly any problems. I've had multiple, high-demanding apps running in the background (games, YouTube, Torrent clients) and the phone does well to keep up with what I throw at it. It does slow down eventually and can appear like it's struggling, but I can imagine that'd be the case with any device after meeting its threshold.- The speakers! I don't use them much, but man oh man when I do, they're a joy. This phone has excellent front facing speakers that really do fill a room. I use this phone for my alarm and every morning hearing this thing blast away some beautiful sounding tunes is a real treat to wake up to.- Build quality. This is not only a nice-looking phone, but if feels well built and constructed. Quite a bit nicer than the price-tag would hint at. I was, and am, thoroughly impressed with it. I've managed to take good care of it, so there's no noticeable scratches on both the backside and the screen. And none have randomly appeared.- The battery! Oh jeez. So when I say that I use this phone A LOT. I sure mean it, and this battery holds up REALLY well. On the way to work, at work, and upon arriving back at home I am usually left with a good chunk of battery life -- 30-40%. It very rarely dips below 20% on a given day, which is freakin' awesome.Things I like about it, but could be better:- It's thin and lightweight. I was super surprised by how thin and light it was and actually very nervous about handling it. However, upon buying and putting on a decent size case which added a little bulk to it, the phone size is just about perfect. But I wouldn't mind it being a bit heavier and maybe a touch thicker, just so if I did end up dropping it I wouldn't feel like it would explode.- The Camera. This takes a bit of trial and error, such as finding an appropriate app that will utilize the camera to it's fullest. The camera is not ""oh wow! Look at that!"" great when I first used it. I had to get accustomed to where and how it worked best. For example, it's not great in low-light environments. Taking a picture at night? Uh, forget about it. It's rough times. But in daytime, with lots going on and lots of things to focus on, the camera does surprisingly well and can -- on occasion -- take some truly spectacular pictures. But those times are few and far between. So I'd recommend finding a different phone if you really want a nice camera on a phone, BUT for the most part this guy does the trick -- just be a bit prepared for figuring out its limitations. Also, the front-facing ""selfie"" camera is surprisingly nice! The few selfies I've taken have turned out better than I'd like to admit!- The pre-installed launcher. Eh, it's not great, but it's not terrible. It can get sluggish and doesn't look the best. There are other options out there that are far better. Also, many of the pre-installed apps sort of fall into the same boat. They're not great, but they're not terrible. I really wish the file managed was better though, because it seems to be the only app that you can voluntarily copy and move files between the internal storage and the micro sd card. Ugh, I think that might be an android issue though...- Sound quality, internal audio amp/driver. Now, I ain't no audiophile or anything like that, but I do appreciate a nice sounding device paired with a nice set of earphones. This phone, similar to its camera, gets the job done, but again there isn't that ""wow! Listen to this!"" feeling. I wasn't buying the phone for its audio capabilities -- internal audio driver -- but with it's awesome external speakers and its partnership (somewhat) with JBL I have to say that I was expecting more. I've used a number of apps with different audio files, but I've owned past devices that have sounded significantly better. Anyway, it's no deal-breaker, but it is a thing and if you're looking for a device with great sound quality, I'd look elsewhere.Overall, I am super happy with this phone. I bought it back when it was $250, and I am shocked it has dropped down to $200. It's a steal at that price. It really is. It's no flagship, IPhone destroyer, but it gets the job done with battery to spare! I really do like it and I think if you're an AT&T costumer looking for a new smartphone for a smart price, then this is it. Everything I've asked it to do -- both usual and ugh...unusual hahah -- it has executed well.If you do end up getting it, here are a few parting recommendations:- purchase a 64gb micro sd card. They're cheap, awesome, and easy to install- Get a case! It makes the phone a bit bigger and easier to handle. I don't like screen protectors, so I can't speak about those.- Look into finding a camera app for the phone. I bought one on Google PlayStore called Cameringo+Effects and I really like it. Just make sure to set it to HD pictures. It'll seem like it has a smaller viewing screen, but the quality of the photos are a TON better than the default picture quality on the app.- Look into finding a different launcher for the phone. I got Nova Launcher Prime and it makes the phone's interface speedier and more user-friendly, and you can customize it off the wazoo.Alright, well that's my 2 cents on this phone. Overall, I think it's great and at $200, it's quite the stealio.","907","Alcatel","2"

I wrote a review on Alcatel's website. To my dismay when I checked back on the review I wrote and how may stars I gave it, had been altered. The stars had been bump up from two to four stars and what I wrote edited by shortening the bad part of the review. I was absolutely disgusted. The phone itself is not bad for the price but the customer service is not good at all. I have heard similar complaints. And the complaints stem from questions to do with updates to the phone. The phone came with Lollipop 5.0. They do not respond when asked by customers regarding updates to the phone. Not on their website, Facebook or speaking to them. Speak to them on updates and they have no answer for you. Because of that I will never buy this phone again.","907","Alcatel","2"

I had to return one due to issues caused by an OTA system update, and the second one has a crackly headphone port, but otherwise it's been great. A fantastic alternative to the ""deals"" offered by the major carriers (I'm lookin at you, AT&T Next)The Phone: The Bad:Really just 1 thing: The headphone port is a little crackly. by that I mean if you plug in headphones, and nudge the the jack, the sound crackles, and you may lose audio in one ear until it sorts itself out. I know this may be a MUCH bigger issue for some people, but I've had devices with crackly headphone ports for years without failing, and really, I am rarely on the move with headphones on, and if I am, I'll be careful to make sure the jack isn't being jostled. I could return the phone again, but I'd have to take another refund and repurchase, and I'm not willing to have $600 tied up in pending Amazon refunds.The Good:Size:I was worried about the size initially. My old phone is a Galaxy 2 Skyrocket. It has a 4"" screen. I thought it was perfect. This took literally no time to get comfortable with. Yes, one hand operation is mostly gone, but it turns out that I don't even notice. It fits in pockets nicely and textured just enough to not be too slick.Screen:I'm no connoisseur of screens, but this thing seems excellent. In a dark room I actually wish it would dim a little more. No problems in full summer sun. colours, saturation and depth are great to my eyes.speakers:surprisingly good. Whatever they did with JBL worked. Similarly for the headphones. Far superior to any headphones I've ever gotten with a phone or music device.Reception:On par with my Samsung and my wife's Nokia Lumia. really like the notification for when I'm on LTE, H+, etc.Wifi:Like a few other devices ( XBox1), it doesn't seem to play well with my Comcast Xfinity home Wifi. Other places it's fine. That's a comcast issue.Camera:meh. it's got a lot of pixels and nice features, but images seem to be noisy when the lighting isnt perfect. My old Samsung was better. Supposedly better after the OTA update.Performance:smooth, fast. Gets a little hot with graphically intense games, but that's normal. Just a hair of lag when downloading/installing multiple apps. Nothing to fret over.UI:Less is more. It's simple, and seems just lightly massaged. preloaded apps are mostly what you'd want anyway.Battery:better than my old Samsung, I don't have a lot to put here. it holds up well to moderate use throughout the day.","907","Alcatel","2"

It has a really bright screen, it's thin, has an sd card slot, fast processor, and front facing speakers. And it has nfc, which the new moto g, oneplus 2, and huawei p8 lite don't have. It's also going to be updated to get protected from the ""Stagefright"" bug soon. Nice to see a company caring about users.However....While this phone was in a bag it got cracked. There was a case on it but it still got cracked. The digitizer did not work so I shipped it to alcatel for repair and it is costing me $100 for them to fix it.So please buy a tempered glass screen, and don't put any pressure on the phone. I even noticed that if you press hard enough you will see spots, I guess from the lcd.If you are looking for a phone that doesn't crack easy and is similar price I recommend the OnePlus One.

"1224","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","4","After using the phone as my daily driver for a month I can honestly say this is one of the best experiences you can have off a budget smart phone. I use the term budget for the description of the price range however the experience is that of a flagship phone. In this review I will talk about the design, hardware, usability, and daily experience of the phone.DesignIts not secret that at this price range you are going to get a plastic phone. With that aside its one of the nicest builds. It have a solid but light feel in the hand. The back is make of a matte metallic sheen that is pleasant to the touch and is not slick and will not attract finger prints. Another note is that the back of the phone is completely flat including the camera does not protrude from the body of the phone. Their is a nice chrome lip all the way around the edge front and back that breaks up the black and gray quite tastefully. Lastly the phone is completely symmetrical. The top and bottom are completely identical with the exception of the excellent front camera and photo-sensor and there is a reason for it. I'll explain more in the experience section.HardwareDespite the price this prince is running a Snapdragon 615 octa-core with 4 cores at 1.5ghz and the other 4 at 1.0ghz and 2GB of ram. It has wifi with 5ghz band and 2.4ghz support. I can say that the wifi works well and has great range (helps if you have a good router as well). LTE is band 12 capable for those who will be using T-Mobile. The rear facing camera is a 13 megapixel Sony sensor with a 8 megapixel front facing camera but shoot at 4:3 aspect ratio. If you want 16:9 HD photos the sensor will go bring the pixel count down to 9.4 mega pixel and 5.1 on the front camera. The display is a bright and beautiful 5.5 inch IPS HD display running at 1920x1080P with 401 pixels per inch. And to tight everything together are JBL powered stereo speakers with 2 microphones one on top and bottom of the phone. All that powered by a 2915mah battery.UsabilityI had a Motorola X (2013) which made usability far better than any phone with its gestures and touchless command prompts beyond what OK Google can do. After having that experience its hard for any phone to compete with that. Going from a 4.7 inch display to a 5.5 inch was quite a jump however thanks to the minimal bezels its make it easy to use. I have small hands and reaching across the screen to the left and the top was a little hard put its still possible. The stereo speakers make it a harder because of the extra bezel it creates still nothing compared to the LG G3 or I phone 6 plus for that matter. The phone is very thin and light making completely unnoticeable in my pocket compared to the weight and thickness of my Moto X. Having the big and bright display with stereo speakers made every media experience amazing. The sound was rich and crystal clear, with good highs and mids, low lows but still better than any other phone out there. The photo-sensor works really well with its software. The screen always had the right amount of brightness, never to much indoors in the dark and you can see the display clearly in direct sunlight not problem. The front facing camera is just a dream with selfies (not that I do much) but video chatting and conferencing is just amazing. Google hangouts is a power app and the phone handles it not problem streaming HD and close to 30fps on a good internet connection. The display also runs at 60fps and drops a bit when moving around but its not even noticeable unless you are watching a fps monitoring software.ExperienceThe as a whole runs pretty smooth about 90% of the time. There are delays in opening apps in comparison to the top flagship phones but its only .5 sec behind in opening apps compared to the galaxy S6 or i Phone 6 plus. Once the app is open or in the ram it responds instantly with no lag. The home screen, multi-task bar, and quick setting menu from the top are lag free. Honestly its runs almost as well as any flagship to the point where you question why you are paying $700+ for a phone. The delay is never frustration or interfering with your task but its noticeable compared to the top flagships. I actually found myself preferring my phone speakers over my Bluetooth speakers because of the clarity was far superior. The phone is running a stock 5.0 android experience with an icon pack install with the Acatel launcher. I actually just installed the google now launcher for a more complete stock look. Not a fan of the bright looking icons on the Acatel launcher. The camera is a pretty awesome however the stock camera app is a flop. The image processing is horrible. I installed the google camera app and it did a much better job with the camera and image processing plus it gives you the ability to change aspect ratio and megapixel options. After all this the batter is a big plus. Its a true all day battery with normal usage and even powers users can get a good amount of usage before needing to charge. I was able to get 6.2 Hrs of on screen time watching Netflix through wifi. When power using during the day I got 4-5 hrs of on screen time. Over all if you want a flagship phone without the flagship price brand new, this is it. There is nothing that compares with it.","907","Alcatel","2"
"1225","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","I've only had this phone for 48 hours. It took less than 24 (including sleep) to have it set up with my favorite stuff. I continually use bluetooth and I'm REALLY active on my phone. Multiple email accounts and multiple active social media accounts. I can still get a full business day, plus some, on a single charge. Despite also still spending lots of time tweaking.It's said the camera may not be up to those of the flagship phones. I haven't tried the camera, yet, to verify that. But keep in mind that the flagships sell between $500-800+ and the Idol 3 is $250. One would expect a difference. Likewise, with the software. Some things have a perceptible difference in opening speed, but not enough to call them slow. And accessories are limited.In contrast, connections are stronger and faster than any previous device I've owned. I happen to live in an area where signal is weak and maybe a little flakey. There are hills and lots of brick homes blocking the two closest towers. Both cell and wifi are faster and cell strength is better. And it handles a 128 gig microsd card.The Idol 3 isn't a flagship killer. But, at the price, one would expect ""good enough"". And it's much closer to flagship than ""good enough"". If you need the fastest and the best, get a flagship. If you want a smartphone that can stand on its own merits, but allows you to spend your money on more important things, this is what you want.","907","Alcatel","2"

Aside from the icons, this phone is basically pure android.

I did some research on this phone including YouTube videos that compared this phone to other budget phones and flagships. This phone has met all of my expectations and then some! I saw remarks about the double tap not being consistent. I actually figured that out. If you do a slower tap it usually works every time. Maybe a quick could ""1,2"" works just about every time. The battery seems good so far. The display is outstanding. I downloaded open camera after a reviewer suggested which is good. My 2 most recent phones were the LG g4 and galaxy s6. The s6 is certainly a great piece of equipment but I realized many of the features they offer I don't need and the price is just too much.

As a baseline for the review, I am not a power user. I only use it for phone calls, texting, checking email, and surfing when I'm not near a computer. For these purposes and needs, this phone is great (so far):- Phone is thin and light. Slim case serves my needs because does not add bulk but still adds protection- Phone looks visually nice (compared to direct competitors like the Zenfone and One Plus)- Screen is big and bright- Sound is way better with two front facing speakers- Battery life lasts the whole day with some to spare- Camera is good (enough). Good for impromptu moments. Don't have high expectations and you will be very pleased with the resultsLag is relative. I don't mind a delay of a nano-second to see what I need or do what I want to do. Overall, I am happy (so far) of the purchase of this phone. It fits my needs perfectly with the price point, features, and aesthetics. I think the Idol 3 is worth more than the $250 retail price. The only difficult part is telling people what phone I have. Alcatel is not a household name, nor is it easy to pronounce. A lot of people ask me about the phone and telling them about Alcatel is the biggest hang up for me. However, I was with T-Mobile when they first started. I was also with Samsung from the beginning. Hopefully I'll hit again with Alcatel.","907","Alcatel","2"

I love it features sometimes I feel like I'm using a Nexus. No Andriod 5.1.1 yet but who cares you're getting a lot for your money! Sometimes I forget this is not a flagship. The camera is OK but honestly I think a software update will fix it since it's the same sensor in the one plus one. So if you have $250 get this phone!!!!!","907","Alcatel","2"
"1257","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","2","I've been using Amazon for almost a decade now. My household spends hundreds if not thousands on amazon purchases annually. I'm not a product review sort of guy. I typically just read through everyone else's comments to determine if a product is worthy or not. Amazon reviews have rarely steered me wrong. In this case I must make an exception and share my experience with the Alcatel one touch idol 3. I love everything about the phone.....except the quality of screen materials. It scratches, and I don't mean a little. I have had all types of phones over the years. Flagships to burners, but I have never experienced such a scratch prone one as the Alcatel. I ALWAYS use a case, but have never bothered with a screen protector since I am very careful with my electronics thus the screens remained pristine. I was very proud of my new bargain phone with flagship specs....until I noticed multiple scratches appear out of nowhere. They are increasing as well so the only possible conclusion is the phone was scratched by pulling it in and out of my pocket...seriously! Nobody else touches my phone, no kids, no pets, no nothing. Well the damage is done, I will put up with it I suppose as the other features of the phone are amazing. You have been warned, good luck my fellow shoppers!","907","Alcatel","2"

Your only able to play a few games without lag but graphic intensive games are going to lag you like crazy. I can't even play something like Dumb Ways to Die 2 without lagging incredibly and that game isn't even graphic intensive. Also, when I only use it for a few minutes it gets extremely hot to the touch on the back, even if I'm just browsing the web it will get really really hot to the point that it stings. The camera is okay...its not that great but it performs really well when there is good lighting but with bad lighting it's super blurry and there is really little detail. Opening apps is a pain in the ass because it takes forever for them to open. Just so you know it has a notification light but with only one color and the double tap to wake sometimes is really unresponsive. But two things that's extremely good about this phone is the speakers and the display. The speakers are extremely loud and the display is really sharp and the colors on the phone are pretty accurate has good contrast. The brightness on this phone when turned max is crazy bright and going outside in the sun won't be a worry when using this phone. I gave it a three instead of something lower because of the speakers and display. Oh yeah the headphones that this phone comes with is really awesome but you gotta be really careful around the tip of its plug thingy since if you bend it, it will break. That's what happened to mine. I only had it for a few months and its already broken so I can't even use it to listen and now I have to use my other headphones.","907","Alcatel","2"

Upon using it for a few months now I have to say that it feels as slow as the Google Nexus (the dual core one by Samsung). The screen managed to develop a tiny yellow spot that seems like someone went over it with a highlighter that won't go away. Buttons are becoming increasingly unresponsive and a refresh of the device hasn't helped.Battery is very average.It's wonderful for watching/listening to shows as the screen still looks pretty decent, especially at that size, the speakers are great, and the included ear buds are pretty decent as well.Still, even after a month of owning this thing I was already disappointed it in.

I'm glad I did. No, it's not perfect, but you have to consider what you get for your money. Other reviewers have gone into great detail about pros and cons so I won't repeat here. There are a few quirks, but in my opinion, the pros far outweigh the cons. I thought there was a problem with my external SD card when I couldn't access files on the card. It turned out my card was formatted in exFat. Once I formatted it to Fat32, all was well. When I was setting up my phone I somehow lost 2 screen panels and ended up with only one. I had to factory reset and that cured the problem. Also, sometimes the screen digitizer can be a little balky. The speakers are quite good as are the included earbuds. Maybe not as good as HTC's, but still good. The screen is very good for a phone at this price point. The camera was also a pleasant surprise. No, it won't beat the Galaxy S6 or iphone6, but you won't be disappointed either. I found no lag others have mentioned, but then again, I don't play games or launch multiple apps at once. For what I do, it was as smooth as butter. You will get through a day on the battery unless you are a heavy user. Unless you're a true perfectionist, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this phone when they consider it cost $250 for a no-contract, unlocked phone.","907","Alcatel","2"

The camera is not going to beat any of the flagship cameras or really any dedicated digital camera.2. It does get hot from time to time (it seems there's similar reports for phones running the Snapdragon 615 chip, so that's the likely culprit).3. Although the screen is very bright, I've noticed it seems washed out from time to time.Aside from these downsides, I think it's still a decent phone over all. Call quality has been good for me. The phone has been plenty fast for most of my tasks which center around web surfing and checking out Facebook. And the battery life is much better than my ancient S3. Over all, it's a phone I would buy again even if Alcatel doesn't provide regular updates (so far according to Reddit it can be rooted and the boot loader seems to be unlocked, so if you feel like experimenting with Cyanogenmod, it may be worth the trouble) in respect to the price.","907","Alcatel","2"
"1268","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","I was looking for a good but affordable phone in March/April of this year and I knew already I would have to buy a used or refurbashed phone. Good but cheap phones just do not exist, until now. Alcatel's usual fare is cheap and lackluster POS's with poor hardware. With the Idol 3 Alcatel has decided to up it's game and came out with their new flagship[ phone. Granted it's no high end flagship killer but for the money you get quite a bit of tech.The good- Beautiful, bright and large 5.5"" screen. Great visibility in sunlight!- 2 stereo front facing speakers that sound better that any other phone I have heard before.- Near stock Android Lollipop.- 2910mAh battery. Great battery life. On a slow day the phone could last 3 days for me easy. On a busy day it will last the day and then some.- Small dimensions for a big phone. One of the thinnest phones I have ever seen. Very light as well.- Build quality looks excellent. Phone looks sleek and stylish.- Camera is great in optimal conditions. Low light it's poor. Might be fixable in an update.- 16GB storage. I consider anything 16GB or higher a positive.- Storage expandable to 128GB with a micro SD card. I popped one in for my music and it's great (I have over 75GB of music and growing.)- Call quality while not being super is average for a cell phone. If you use the speaker phone option it sounds great.- Phone can be completely used upside down, even on calls!- Reception is great for me. Where as on my Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket I was always getting 1-2 bars. On the Idol 3 I get 3-5 bars. However, reception will very greatly for each person.- SIM unlocked and usable on both AT&T and T-Mobile, including 4G LTE.- Free earbuds. Their not great but their decent and get the job done.- Of course the price!BadBesides the phone not having a removable battery (which is usually a must for me), I personally i can't think of anything bad on this phone. There are a few small things but these should all be fixable on software updates down the road. Alcatel has already conformed they will keep this phone updated for the standard lifespan of a cell phone, usually 18 to 24 months.- Phone can lag a bit. Use the close apps button on the recent apps screen to keep the phone performing optimally. Keeping unused apps out of memory will greatly affect performance. The processor is not the latest and greatest but it does it's job, especially for battery life.- Camera in low light conditions.That's about it for me. I was wary about buying an Alcatel phone as I usually buy either Samsung, HTC or LG but this is a very nice and affordable phone. I highly recommend this phone.*** UPDATE ***Alcatel sent out a performance update less than 2 months after release. I know of only one other company that does faster updates so this is pretty good. I don't know all the things that were in the update but I can say is that it fixed the following issues: UI lag (the user interface no longer has lag when using it), Double Tap to Wake works perfectly now, some minor camera issues were fixed. cell signal dropping sometimes when using LTE was fixed. Also there were a few UI and camera tweaks added as well. Overall the update was great and makes the phone perfect.","907","Alcatel","2"

"1272","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","3","To preface this review: I am coming from a Nexus 4, which had served me well up till the most recent Android updates, which have been buggy and have killed the battery life on what was previously an almost perfect device.Now, onto the Idol 3: It's a gorgeous phone, with a big, bright & crisp screen and lovely design. The UI has been lightly skinned, which is a good thing as I'm a fan of stock Android. Benchmark scores aren't top notch, but they blow away the Nexus 4 and are just about on par with the Samsung S4. For the price, you're getting a lot of phone here.Yet, there are some significant areas for improvement: Shutter speed is quick but indoor photos are noisy. There's a bit of general UI lag, which isn't that obtrusive. These issues aren't monumental considering the price. More concerning: when browsing certain Flash-heavy sites using Chrome or the stock browse, such as ESPN or Boston.com, the browser lags/stutters to the point that it's essentially unusable. This is a serious issue as we obviously use our phones as portable web browsers a lot. To have a phone that can't navigate well through who knows how many different sites is a near deal-breaker. Other users on various web forums are experiencing the same thing, so it's not just me. Also note that I haven't overloaded the phone with a ton of random apps to muddy the waters.I've only had the phone for a day or two, so hopefully this is a launch issue, but if Alcatel can't push an fix within the next couple of weeks, this thing is going back.3-stars with the stuttering browser issue, otherwise, this is a 5-star phone.","907","Alcatel","2"

Once I heard Alcatel was selling a phone with such good specs at such a low price I jumped at the pre-order and I am so glad I did. Although the phone was delivered to my neighbor, and after some worried searching saw it on their porch, I have no problems since my order was upgraded to two day shipping.The device is very light weight and very thin. Its screen is beautiful and very bright. Full, rich color from all viewing angles. The speakers are much better than expected, very loud with solid lows and sharp highs. The headphones provided are of very good quality with phenomenal sound and deep bass. The rear camera is quite good for videos but sub par for stills. The quality in a low light setting is very dull and scratchy. The front camera is a different story. Very rich detail and contrast with a very noticable difference in a low light setting, the pictures are much clearer.The battery is very good. With an average day of usage mostly consisting of YouTube and Facebook I had almost 35% left at the end of the day.The snapdragon processor is a big plus in this device. It is very snappy and holds its own in demanding apps. There is a little lag only when clearing recent apps.The android 5.0 is excellent and very clean on this device.Although the phone is made out of plastic, I must say it has a very durable and quality feel to it. Since the back cannot be removed there is no creaking when force is applied.Overall I must say that this phone is worth every penny and I would highly reccomme d to anybody on a budget.","907","Alcatel","2"

While it fixed the double tap to wake issue that previously worked inconsistently, it broke Google Voice interception of outbound calls. Therefore, this phone is nearly unusable to me as a phone, since my primary number is a Google Voice number. As a very inconvenient workaround, I now have to load the Google Voice webpage in order to make a call. I am now considering to replace this phone and do not recommend it to anyone who uses Google Voice to make outbound calls. If you already have this phone and use Google Voice, DO NOT INSTALL THE LATEST UPDATE!---------------------------------------Original review:The Idol 3 is an excellent phone for the $200 pre-order price. At the $250 regular price, I recommend weighing the pros and cons against two-year old flagship phones that sell for a similar price. I am looking forward to Alcatel addressing some of the ""cons"" listed below with a firmware update.Pros:- Beautiful, 5.5"" screen- Good battery life- Android Lollipop experience without the unnecessary clutter- Very good speakers for a cell phone- Micro SD card slotCons:- Double tap to wake feature is so unreliable that it may as well not exist- Minimum volume setting for notifications and ringtones is too loud- Screen sometimes does not go to sleep after set time period- Poorer performance in day-to-day use (non-intensive apps, web browsing, e-mail) than 2-year old flagship phones that now sell for the same price, such as an LG G2- Home screen should have the option of fitting 5 columns of icons instead of just 4- Poorer low-light camera performance than an LG G2 (too much noise)- Non-removable battery- High, hard-to-reach power button","907","Alcatel","2"

However my phone came with a non-functioning gesture keyboard. And if that was not bad enough I attempted to call Alcatel to try and resolve the issue. First I download Alcatel support app, it has a 800 number that is non-functional (strike 1). Then I tried to call a number listed in the manual, no one is there on weekends and holidays, (strike 2). And last but not least is the question who releases a phone so that it arrives on a holiday weekend and does not have support available in any fashion what so ever. (strike 3). While I did fix the keyboard issue by downloading a free keyboard app I would like to have the original equipment/software work properly.

I underestimated myself this weekend and it dropped on the floor of a bus, I was shuffling my feet without knowing the phone was face down on the floor and boom.. scratched screen. Screen protector was already on order and being delivered the following monday :( Totally my fault obviously, but just wanted to warn you guys to definitely get a screen protector and do not chance it with this phone, because almost all the features on this phone are awesome for the price!Screen is beautiful and bright and clear, reminds me of my samsung note 2 AMOLED screen, very clear. keeping the costs down had to be taken somewhere and it is the non scratch resistant screen.Speed seems adequate. I havent really tested its full potential but this is going to be my second phone.sound is AMAZING, JBL speakers and it really shows, Even when plugging it into my car, the sound seems better than my previous phone.Camera app needs some work, or maybe just a different app would work. I was hoping it would take better macro pictures and focus fast on that type of scene but it doesn't for me.size is similar to my note 2, a little bit too big for my hand. But its pretty thin which makes up for that.The power button and volume buttons are high up so reaching them takes some hand maneuvering. you might not think of it much, but once you notice it..Battery life seems pretty good, you could probably get a good day and a half with normal/light usage. It seems like a stock version of android 5.0 lollipop with no bloatware which helps a lot with battery life as well.Overall I think for 200 this is a great deal. Just wish i didn't jump the gun and use it unprotected.Update #1:browsing around the Google app store, I found Open Camera, which is a great alternative to use,. It has a lot of features and macro mode which I was complaining about, and this phone seems to take great macro photos at about 5 inches away.Update #2: Camera app alternativeI had a chance to do some outdoor macro photos and I am VERY impressed with how it did! Using Open Camera and having it on macro mode setting, focusing was for the most part pretty quick and I added some photos to see.Update #3 - 11-5-16 Sold phone a long time ago..Sorry can't provide any further updates on this phone. Judging by the Amazon price for this phone, there are plenty of other phones I would rather get with equal or better specs.","907","Alcatel","2"

Alcatel should absolutely take one more iteration on this phone and they will have something just about perfect.First let's talk about the pros:- Price - absolutely amazing value for the buck- Speedy - plenty fast enough for almost anyone needs, very fee stutters navigating around- camera is actually one of the best I've used outside of a very few phones- almost everything not listed as a con. Seriously this thing is very good overall.Now the cons, which are minor, but eventually they will become deal breakers:- Bluetooth audio is very very hollow sounding. Any media (music, podcasts, phone calls) sounds like you're listening to it over a tin can telephone. If you ever use Bluetooth you'll notice this almost immediately.- Power button in an un-intuitive location. Seriously guys it's standard on Android to have the volume and power button on the right side. Having volume on the right and power on the left is just a needless change. Just put it where everyone else does.- It may just be my device, but a week ago the combination SIM tray and SD card tray (in an of itself a real pain to load and unload) just seemed to stop working. My photos stopped backing up and calls wouldn't go through. I'd get a replacement but with the other issues I'll just get a refund.Again I really like the idea Alcatel was going for and they should definitely just fix these few issues and will have a great flagship-level phone.","907","Alcatel","2"

I hadn't had any real problems out of it except for when it did not wake up at one time. I tapped, I pressed the power button and I even called it, mind you this was after the most recent update. I ended up having to do a hard reset on it, so far no further problems. The only thing that I don't like is that you don't have access to emojis on social media but other than its a very good phone definitely worth $250 bucks.UPDATE!!!!!!!Well I have had this phone for a while now and I loved it, the only problems Ive had with this phone are ones that Ive caused myself, as far as the phone messing up on its own, no problems. The worst thing about this phone is the screen is not durable at all, one tap against a chair and it cracks and the screen does not work, cant unlock it, cant do anything, my galaxy s3 is way more durable than this. I recommend getting a tempered glass protector for it and the most durable case you can, but generally as long as you have the tempered glass you can just about use any case you would like. Ive searched all over for a phone that might compare to this, tired of Samsung products and their UI and notification sounds, to poor for anything else that I might genuinely like, ran across the HONOR 5X but it doesnt have a reversible interface and it hasnt been released yet, I'm not patient enough to wait a couple months for reviews so I figure I will just order this again, Win WIn.","907","Alcatel","2"

Then, it happened. I don't know how it happened which is the hardest part because I woke up last Sunday morning to a broken digitizer. I pulled the phone out of the lower pocket of my cargo shorts that it had resided in several times since purchase and there it was - that inch-long crack across the top right corner of the screen. Along with it came the disabled lower half of the screen to any input.I ordered a digitizer on ebay for $25 despite the lack of online tutorials for replacing anything on this new-ish phone. Please note - it is not very difficult to get into, but you will find it nearly impossible to reassemble this phone without having rendered it completely useless during disassembly!The design (speakers near the edges) doesn't lend itself to any sort of meaningful case usage.So, here I am back to using my nearly 3 year old Samsung Galaxy S4 :(I tried, Alcatel.","907","Alcatel","2"

I switched from a Galaxy S6 Edge because the Edge was constantly lagging and stuttering. I couldnt believe how terrible it was--a $750 phone!!! So, I did my due diligence and researched sub $300 phones that I could replace it with. I came across the one touch 3 and the ASUS Zenfone. I decided to go with the One Touch because although it has less processor capacity and ram than the Zenfone it made up for it in battery longevity, screen quality, and front facing speakers.The reviews were so right. The screen is beautiful. The front facing speakers sound just as good as on the HTC One M9. I have not experienced ANY of the lag I experienced on the S6 Edge (probably because there is little to no bloatware running in the background.)The battery also provides about 1.5 hours more screen on time than the S6.Get this phone.

"1311","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","So far, a great phone. I did a lot of research when deciding on a new phone in this price range. I listen to a lot of music on the run and the tipping point in favor of the Idol 3, for me, was the front facing stereo speakers.I've had the phone for a few days now, and I'm very impressed with it. The user interface is pretty much stock Lollipop, which I really appreciate. There is very little bloatware/shovelware taking up memory and what there is can be easily removed. The camera is average and takes decent pictures under the right conditions. Bluetooth paired up with all my devices, even the more finicky devices that have given me fits in the past. Call quality is really good and the voices are clear on both ends. Signal reception has been the same as my old phone and I have had no issues connecting to the network. WIFI connections are as expected and I have had no issues.I dropped in a 128Gb micro SD card and it is working as expected. I haven't had a chance to test out the NFC connection, but It's nice to have this capability.The real shocker is the sound quality. The front facing stereo speakers are really impressive. They are loud and you can crank it up with no distortion. Everyone I've demo'ed this for has had the same reaction, ""Whoa, that is impressive"". Are you going to replace your home sound system? Of course not, But you get some pretty big sound from some pretty small speakers. The other surprise was from the included ear buds. I wasn't expecting much, but they sound pretty good for being included in the box. They have flat, no tangle cables and include different size ear pieces. They are a little flat sounding in the mid range, but not objectionably so. They won't replace my more expensive ear buds, but if these were the only ones I had, I'm not sure I would be that quick to replace them. I definitely won't be throwing these out.All in all I am very happy with this phone. It has great features and the sounds is incredible. On top of all that it functions well as a phone. In my opinion, this is a good value for the money.","907","Alcatel","2"
"1312","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","3","I""m giving this phone a 3 because there seems to be (for me) a fundamental flaw in the ergonomics of the phone. The way the switches are set up they are never in the right place. Also, I seem to be constantly grabbing the phone and hitting the switches at the same time, which seems to try and shut the phone down, or take a screenshot of the phone, neither of which I like. It took me a while to figure out that when I was trying to shoot a photo I was gripping the phone in a manner that I hit the buttons and it kept shutting down.I've had similar android phones and never had this issue.The icons are cartoon-y (I put an icon pack in to create shortcuts so I didn't have to look at them) and the phone seems rather slow to respond (for example, when you change screens or shut down the open apps). The phone seems to work ok, when I'm not having trouble manipulating it, and the setup was relatively simple and straightforward (coming from another unlocked android).I would not buy the phone again, but will keep it for now as I don't want the hassle of getting another phone. My old one stopped working so this purchase, while researched, was made a bit more quickly than I might of liked.","907","Alcatel","2"

The first phone I received had a failed LCD panel when I took it out of the box (box and packaging had no visible damage). The second one's LCD panel is seperating from the phone's casing and I've been very gentle with it for the few months I've had it. Given this 0/2 track record so far as the two I've received, I can't recommend this phone, especially since purchasing the international version (this version) via Amazon means you won't have a manufacturer warranty for any defects or repairs.The phone also performs more poorly than the Moto G 3rd Gen (same price range, but better build quality) on the original firmware, the newest official firmware, and several of the third party firmwares I've tried (CM, BlissPop, RR, and others).","907","Alcatel","2"

I was a little sceptical about reading a lot of negative reviews about the camera on this phone, but I also own the Alcatel Pop One Touch, which takes very nice pictures usually without even using the flash! So, the first I did was to compare my old phone camera with the new one. I took the same pictures side by side, and this is what I found. Out of the box the new cameras exposure settings needed to be adjusted. If you click on the upper left of the camera screen, (there are three short lines), then choose settings--you will see exposure settings, click on the number 1 setting-- (Not -1). This will lighten up the screen for better picture taking. Under normal circumstances, you will not need a flash even inside your home! This will greatly improve your all around camera quality!! Hope it helps!! Great phone!","907","Alcatel","2"

Yeah, it's slower than the Sammie S6 I got from work, but it isn't a long, painful wait for it to complete a task, just a slight hesitation. Unless you are a serious power user I doubt you'll have a problem with performance. The battery life is better than the S6. And it works as well as the Samsung as an actual phone (yes, I actually make calls on my phone... I'm old).The rear camera is fine... far better than my photography, that's for sure. I don't do selfies, so I don't know how well the front camera works (as indicated above, I'm old).The sound is MUCH better than the Samsung, both from the speaker and headphones, and the music program is easy to use and plays FLAC files.It is light enough that even with an armored case it isn't too heavy, and I quickly got used to the size. It is easier to carry on my belt, but it fits in my pocket. The S6 seems too small to me now, and I will almost certainly get another 5.5"" phone next time..I would have no hesitation buying another Alcatel phone when this one is ready to retire in another year or two. Or maybe three if it keeps working, since it certainly is meeting my phone, e-mail, snapshot and web surfing needs very well.","907","Alcatel","2"
"1338","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","3","Decent phone, shame it died one day after the one year warranty ended. It was while I was playing kingdom hearts unchained x. Symptoms were: phone got hot, touch screen became unresponsive on and off, the next day blue screen, rebooted, another blue screen, then phone completely died.Dual front facing speakers that get nice and loud so that's a huge plus, mine came with jbl earbuds which is awesome considering how most phones don't even include them anymore. But, the placement of the auxiliary port is located at the top of the phone and this is weird because the mini usb port is located on the bottom. If you used one of those magnetic air vent phone holders for you car, things will get messy as there's no clear orientation to have good cable management when you want to plug the auxiliary cable to your phone while charging. However, the reversible design is nice so that you can make the auxiliary cable be located on the bottom relatively by putting the phone upside down.Coming from a samsung galaxy s3, the idol 3's screen is much more vibrant. Also the phone is about 7mm thin which is just 1mm thicker than the thinnest phone out there. Also you should plan on getting a case for the phone, the back of this phone is really slippery with zero grip which is awful for such a thin phone. So if you get sweaty hands due to the heat emitted from this phone, the chance of it falling is quite high. Another plus was that alcatel did provide a software update to Android Marshmallow, which no one thought they would do considering the idol 4 was coming out, the idol 3 was made by a chinese company which don't really provide software support, and that the idol 3 was a budget phone. The stock os doesn't really come with a lot of bloat, although surprisingly, the clock app that comes with the phone is actually made by avg, the same guys that make the antivirus, which no one would have found out until one day play store decided to update the clock app. The updated clock app was terrible because it went away from the google's material design to some awkward interface. The average rating was around 2 stars before avg reverted back to the original clock app. The biggest con I would have to mention is the very slow flash storage, this is really noticeable when you load files or install apps in the play store.Oh well, time to get a new phone and this is just a lesson to always back up your texts and photos as well as get an extended warranty if you plan on using the phone for a very long time. Especially on devices like these where there is no removable back cover. I set the expected usage to a year anyways when I bought the phone considering it was only 250 when I bought it. The phone did get cheaper, but that's to be expected as time goes on.-----update 9/13/16---------Wow, so they still honored the warranty when my phone died. Fantastic service; they went above and beyond. They shipped the phone back with 2 day ups air too.","907","Alcatel","2"

"1340","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","I have had the phone for a week now and here is my honest opinion. As you see, that I have given the phone 5 stars. This rating is for comparison to other phones in it's price range. I am not going to try and compare this phone with IPhone or Samsung. I have T-Mobile and I am on a no-contract employee plan that requires me to buy my phones outright. So price is a BIG deal. IMO the phone is great! Here are my honest thoughts:- Screen Size and looks is great! Very readable in the sun. Well above it's $250 price tag- The ONLY lag I ever experience is when I am sweeping running apps. And that is hardly a lag. It is very fluid and responsive.- No Dropped Calls- My LTE T-Mobile data has been 12.5 mbps- Front facings speakers are amazing and sound great. BUT they are louder than I want them to be at the lowest setting. I have Triplets Babies and when they are asleep, I can't have headphones in and the audio on the lowest setting is still too loud.- The Camera is Great! No issues or complaints.- The double tap to turn it on is unreliable and works less than 50% of the time. Double tapping to turn off works just fine.- BUT I am right handed and I have no issues with where the on/off button is. I don't know why others have complained.- I love the I can talk into either end of the phone. Especially when using the google search. It hears me every time!- The GPS is great and on-time! The front facing speakers were great to hear the turn by turn directions.- The head phones sound great!- The reversible setting is awesome and such a duh idea.- This may be an Android problem but is really annoying… but any group messaging that I have gets a date of Jan 17, 1970 and so they just sit at the bottom of my messages log. It’s VERY Annoying and I can’t figure out how to fix that. Anyone else have this problem?- Battery Life is about a day in a half. I use my phone mostly with Calls, Texts, Twitter, Facebook, Email, Camera, Internet. (Occasionally the GPS and Netflix, no gaming.)- In all, the phone is not ""perfect"". But just as close as it's going to be at this price. Definitely worth 5 stars and I recommend it every time!Now I just need a case. Not a bulky one. Any recommendations?","907","Alcatel","2"

The front facing speakers sounds great and the reversible screen is plain ol' genius, makes perfect sense. No more fumbling for your Phone, it has a lag to it when your performing some task (mainly task manager), but its ok. Good battery life (for the screen size), I get a whole day out of a charge. I really love the phone, especially because I've always bought unlocked phones but this one does it all at a fraction of the cost!!!! Highly recommended. Get tons of compliments on the look and sound quality......Sad to say I took the case off the phone to swap out my sd card and dropped the phone and wouldn't you know it, the screen cracked in the upper right corner. now the touch is inconsistent making the phone useless.

"1349","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","I've had this phone for a week and must say it lives up to the hype. A great midrange phone for budget price. $250 is a steal and I envy you who got the $199 deal.If you know this phone exists then you've most likely already seen reviews, you already know the good. You're here because you want to know what's bad right?ConsButton Placement - Its like this phone is made for lefties, I don't know what Alcatel was thinking when they inserted the power button WAYYY to the top left. You'll try to substitute with double tap to wake but it only works .75 of the time and you'll find it better to simply click the power button. The up/down volume buttons is something it will take a LONG TIME getting use to. I'm so used to the volume buttons being on the mid-left instead of top right... What were they thinking!? LolConnection - When I first got the phone it seemed to drop connection a bit, I'd say 1/5 calls. I was kinda pissed at first BUT the past 3 days it hasn't dropped any and I make lots of phone calls since I'm a supervisor and have a lot of unreliable employees. Also I live in Miami not like in the middle of no where so I have good reception.Camera - If you're coming from a high end device this rear facing camera won't impress you. Coming from a 8MP Galaxy S3 I'd say this camera JUST gets the job done. This camera is pretty bad at catching light if you take a picture at 12PM it looks like it was taken 6PM. Take it at 7PM it looks like it was taken 11PM. If you post 10 pictures on IG & FB everyday you'll probably want to aim for something with a better camera.Not trying to poop on the camera because like I said it gets the job done.In contrast the 8MP front facing camera is great. One of the few phones on the market with something above a 5MP front facing camera.Those are the only small negatives I can think of BUT its not really deal breaking which is why I still gave it 5 stars. If you're on the fence just click purchase you won't regret it. If so simply return it within 30 days. 😄","907","Alcatel","2"

The very bright and sharp display is easy to read in sunlight, the sound is as clear and loud as I've ever seen in a smartphone. Was worried that the 5.5"" screen would feel too big in my hand, but it actually fits well in my hand. The power button placement is a little high on the left side, but I've already gotten used to it. 4G LTE reception with Cricket Wireless has been solid, and I get a full day of battery life, even with a few hours of screen time. The phone feels thin and light but still feels solid.

The N5 was a great phone for me other than the horrendous battery life. Fast forward to the present and I wanted even more screen real estate. I knew I wanted at least 5.5"", maybe even 6"". I just couldn't justify spending north of $400+ for a N6, G4, S6, etc though. When the Idol went for sale for $180 on Amazon Prime Day I had to take the chance even though this phone was completely off my radar. The Idol 3 makes the Nexus 5 feel/look like old newsIdol 3 as compared to the Nexus 5:**Screen**The screen is just as good as the N5, I'd say even better as there isn't horrendous white light bleed along the edge at extreme viewing angels. The extra half inch really makes a difference in media consumption.**Battery**Oh wow! It's nice to have a battery again!I had a QI wireless charger for my N5 at work. Probably a good thing too or I would have sold my N5 a long time ago as we all know the battery blows on the N5. While I'd prefer that the Idol had wireless charging ability, I can live without it as I can easily get 2 days of use. It's so odd looking at the battery percentage and not see it drop like a rock during the day. I need to look into aftermarket wireless micro usb charger + case to conceal it. Hopefully I can find the thinnest most ""stock"" looking combo.**Speakers**The speakers? OMFGBBQ!!! I sometimes listened to the N5 streaming music on it's lone speaker when working on projects. It provided fill and it passed the time. The Idol's speakers are exponentially better. Heck I don't even think I've had them over 3/4 volume. I don't think I can buy another phone that DOESN'T have two forward facing speakers now. I'm spoiled now.**Performance**Feels on par with my N5. Yeah I see a stutter here and there when loading a page or what not but it's in no way a deal breaker for me.**Reception**I'm on TMO's $30 5gb prepaid plan and I get crap for cellular reception in my house. Luckily I get LTE @ my work. So I've completely converted to Google Hangouts VOIP. I use wifi @ home for calls, LTE data while I'm away from the house. After a week things have been great so far for my coverage and use.**Feel**Lighter, thinner than the N5. Only con is the Idol is a slippery sob! I really have to mind my Ps and Qs when handling it. I like my phones to be naked as I don't like the bulk. However I think I'll have to just bite the bullet and get a case for this, not only for the wireless charging listed above, but for grip as well as protection cause yeah I don't think the Idol is gonna take well to abuse :(**Conclusion**Well I was able to sell my N5 for $180 on CL in a day. Since I basically stole the Idol for $180 from that Amazon sale I got a GREAT upgrade for free :) I'm a happy camper.Now that the boot-loader is unlocked on the Idol I'm anxiously awaiting how performance will increase with a custom rom.

"1390","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","This is the cheapest phone I've ever bought and one of the best I've ever had. Having used it constantly everyday for almost a month now I knew I had to review it.Let's start with the physical: The phone is thin with a sleek design comparable to some flagships out there. It is ultra lightweight to the point that I don't feel it in my purse; sometimes I actually rummage through my bag to make sure it's still there. The screen is big and pictures are clear and crisp. Same sound-wise, I haven't had any dropped calls or had people on the other end telling me they can't hear me so it's definitely a jump up from my last android which was more than double the price.Now the technical: To start with I purchased a 32gb SDHC card to take advantage of the expandable storage so I didn't have to skimp out on any apps I used, and as a long time T-Mobile customer I was able to get the SIM card for free. I immediately put the cards in and voila I had a working phone. [Disclaimer: There are no features from T-Mobile that I do not have access to, unless there are features out there that I am not aware of].So the important stuff, I am in love with the eye scanner (HOW COOL IS THAT) which can be used as a lock screen mechanism. It makes me feel like a secret spy agent! Unlike fingerprint readers which seem outdated now, I'm able to impress my friends and family with an eye scanner. I also very much enjoy the camera which pulls up with two presses of the power button, it beats tapping on a screen that isn't always responsive in a moment's notice. I can capture vital images quickly and accurately in a moving vehicle or when I'm at a concert, which is simply awesome especially for the price tag. Lastly, the fast charging nature of this phone puts me in awe. I use the phone for hours on end and yes the battery drains like a normal phone does, but then all I have to do is plug it in and my phone gets charged in no time! I can also keep playing my games, video chatting and having multiple apps and webpages open with no lag and without pausing to let the phone charge, and a regular car charger gets my phone charged even when I have Waze or Google Maps on.Overall I highly recommend this phone, if it somehow died I would buy another one without hesitation. This phone is comparable to flagships in terms of design and basic features one looks for in a phone. And for the price it truly is unbeatable without being inferior.","907","Alcatel","2"

"1403","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","I've had this phone for about a month & I have nothing but good thing to say about it. Here's what I think after one month:PRO- Inexpensive, loud stereo speakers, some nifty & unique features, good (day) camera & very slim profile and not to mention very light- Good battery: the battery should last a day even with heavy use. I'm not a heavy user and mine actually lasted one & half day with single charge.- Bright large 5.5"" full HD (1080P) screen.- Unlocked, no contract and no preloaded garbage apps- Able to add more memory up to 128 GB using microSD card.CONS- Handling: This is a big phone so the combination of size, thinness and low weight will be an issue for small hands.- Performance is somewhat sluggish when compared to my older phones such as LG G3, Note 3 and my Fire phone.- Low light photography - Indoor & @ night, must use flash.- Battery is not replaceable.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -This is my second Alcatel phone. After my first one which was returned promptly I vowed not to buy another but after reading the reviews & partly because of Amazon one day special sale (got it for $199) I gave it a try. And now, I think this phone is worth every penny. This is by far the best phone Alcatel has made. They were able to put some mid to premium features into this phone and sell at a very low budget price.DESIGN & BUILTThis phone is very elegent. It got rounded edges framing a metalic like body. The screen sits slightly over the JBL speakers on top and bottom which makes the overall look very unique. The back camera takes great outdoor photos during the day but at night you'll need to use flash.SPECIAL FEATURES- Reversible interface - Phone has speakers and microphone on top and bottom and once you activate the feature, it doesn't matter which side you hold up to make or receive calls. I've never seen this feature on any other phone before.- Double-tap lock screen feature - They copied this from LG G series phones. The implementation of it though is somewhat sluggish. You have to tap it a few times before the screen turns on or off.CAMERA- IDOL3 has a 13-megapixel auto-focus rear camera, and an above average 8-megapixel front-facing for selfies. The lens is flush to the back, so there’s no raised section like the new iPhone or Galaxy S6 and others. On the software side, the layout is simple but it does come with a variety of shooting modes and interestingly there is also a manual mode with shutter speed control. The camera delivers decent looking photos in moderately lit conditions with nice details and saturated colors. However, it seems to struggle with low lit situation and with no flash, you get hazy details with some noticeable noise. But on the plus side, it does have electronic image stabilization feature which helps to keep things steady especially when you're working with the manual mode with low shutter speed. Also the latest OTA update has significantly improved the camera's performance. Colors look nicer, it focus better and snaps photos faster. If you get this phone be sure to get the latest OTA update.BATTERY PEFORMANCEThe 2910 mAH last me the full day and even after 24 hours I still had 30% left and so this is one big plus for this phone.Overall I highly recommend this phone. There are very few phones that can match the features with such a low price. Oneplus one (last year version) which is now readily available is the one of only two true competitor. That phone is faster but its 64 GB version is $75 more and with IDOL 3 you can add up to 128 GB of SD so from that standpoint its ahead. The other phone is Zenfone 2 which is $50 more but from what I read, there's a lot of shortcoming with that phone. Anyway, if you're looking for a feature rich, low price, no contract phone, you can't go wrong with IDOL 3.","907","Alcatel","2"

I would recommend this for anyone who's hard of hearing.I was deciding between this and the Asus ZenFone2 and went by reviews both had good reviews, but I went with the Idol.The camera is good, but I use a different camera app with it for more effects.The battery life is great and it charges quickly more than an Android tablet I have.The screen is nice and clear, the ease of access is good and Alcatel does do the update, for it when it lets you know for an OTA.The only non-issues I have that's there's not enough accessories being the fact it's been out for a few months. Been looking for a Qi charging receiver, tho Alcatel has one, but no one has made a review for it on here. B 3 bottom right is what I'm searching for.I really don't do reviews, but this I thought I would do.","907","Alcatel","2"
"1406","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","For the price, the only device that can compare to this for the price is the zenfone 2. The zf2 has a more powerful processor, GPU and 2x the ram for $50 more. Even though I'm usually all about specifications on my devices, I don't play graphically intense games on my phone. (that's what a PC or console is for in my opinion) So I'll take the better screen, slimmer profile, almost completely stock version of Android and the dual JBL audio front facing speakers any day over the slight difference in performance.I've seen some reviews of people receiving units with a few annoying problems but I'm assuming those are either factory defects or refurbished units because I've had nothing but good experiences so far with mine.If I had to find something negative to say about this phone, I'd say the power button placement doesn't make sense at all even for a lefty. But the factory software does allow for double tap to wake and the display does rotate 180° in portrait which takes care of the button placement for the most part. The second thing is that I've noticed a few stutters here and there, and considering I came from a note 3 with the SD800, these slight stutters happen so infrequently that it doesn't bother me and I didn't really pay attention to them till I read about it in some reviews. Either way, I'm pretty sure this is because of the software optimization because other SD615 devices run smother. Hopefully an update to 5.1 or even marshmallow will cure this. If not, bootloader is already unlocked, root is her and there's already twrp available. Custom ROMs should be available soon too.","907","Alcatel","2"

Granted the Idol doesn't have the benchmarks of the N5 (or the ZenPhone2) but I haven't noticed it at all in everyday use.If you want a great unlocked phone (with all the GSM LTE bands) and don't want to pay $600, get this phone.","907","Alcatel","2"

"1416","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","1","I read Amazon reviews on this product, and determined that the Alcatel ONETOUCH IDOL 3 would fit my needs perfectly due to the product specifications and price point. I could not be more wrong. I have switched brands of cell phones over the years, varying from Apple, LG, Motorola RAZR, Nokia, and even Cingular phones. Nothing I have used in the last ten years has been as fragile and poorly made as this one. While reaching into my pocket to read a text message I just received, I went to swipe my phone to unlock. However, the glass surface (digitizer) of the phone would not recognize my swipes, and started trying to swipe all on its own. I thought this was bizarre, and upon closer inspection there were some small cracks on the top left corner of the phone. After trying to swipe further, the crack spread all the way from the top left to the center right of the digitizer, effectively making the phone useless. Since this was in my pocket previously, I have no idea how it cracked, since it was working fine and had no issues throughout the day. It is utterly pathetic that this product broke INSIDE my pocket, and their customer service team has been even worse in terms of honoring any warranty or protection from this brittle, cheaply-made phone. I would recommend any other smartphone instead of this one, because it is not acceptable in 2015 to have phones so fragile you must bubble wrap them before storage.Summary: If you are looking for an unlocked phone, go with another brand, because it will actually work and not break inside your pocket within two months of purchase. Just go here (http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/wireless/2407749011/ref=s9_acsd_ri_bw_clnk?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-5&pf_rd_r=0MPS87YSGRVP9GKHPS5D&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=2153843082&pf_rd_i=2407749011_p0_h) and make sure whatever you do, never, EVER get an Alcatel ONETOUCH Idol 3.","907","Alcatel","2"

The good stuff is outstanding, and what little bad stuff there is is easy to overcome. It's an amazing phone for a great price point. Except...(I'll get to that in a minute).PROS:--Great screen and visibility. Even in bright sunlight and from different angles, the screen is sharp and easy to see. I purchased a tempered glass screen protector, but that might be overkill.--The internal radios are fine. I have no trouble picking up AT&T LTE signals.--Super stereo effect from the twin JBL speakers with good volume when listening in speaker mode.--Great form factor. Though the phone is big, it's very slim and fits the hand easily, and it looks great. I bought a sturdy case in part to keep the screen from contacting tabletops and to give it a little extra ""grip,"" though.--For basic day-to-day use, the battery is amazing. With ordinary call activity and web surfing, I can get 2+ days easily.--The flip feature, letting you use the phone easily right side up or upside down is really cool.--While some complain about the placement of the power button high on the left edge, I like it. I tend to use the phone in my left hand, so that works well for me.--It's (almost) pure Android, so very intuitive.--The cameras produce excellent photos in decent light...but...MINOR CONS:--As others have noted, the pix are noisy in less-than-ideal lighting. The preloaded camera app is awkward to use, but I simply added Open Camera (free on Google Play).--Several of the other pre-loaded apps are weak to worthless, but easy enough to ignore.--For as good as the speakers are in speakerphone mode, they sound rather tinny in standard mode.MAJOR CON:--Here's what has me worried. This baby gets REALLY hot really quickly when watching videos or playing games. I'm concerned that over time, that will be a huge issue for battery longevity. I'm not a big gamer or video watcher, but if you are, you'd be well served looking for something else.","907","Alcatel","2"

Amazon sent a replacement, so all is well. I really like this phone. It operates fast enough to where I don't notice any delay, I really like the display, and I really like the minimum changes that they made to Android. I have had a few other phones in the last couple years, and I always prefer stock Android to other heavily modded UIs. I don't know why other companies think they can improve on something I am sure Google spent a lot of time developing...Pros- UI- The reversible speaker and home screen. I prefer having the headphone jack at the bottom when listening to music.- ScreenCons- My only complaint is that the double tap on feature doesn't work consistently. I think this has to do with the lock screen being engaged or not, or possibly how long the device has been asleep. I hope they fix it in the next few","907","Alcatel","2"

I bought new one and am returning that defective one for refund. Are the boxes supposed to be sealed with plastic wrap because the second phone I got wasn't wrapped in plastic,... Forgot if the first one was. Great speaker and screen. I first bought an Asus zenfone 2 but returned that because the speaker and screen were incredibly bad. Idol 3 totally beats in those respects. Will update over time.Update 7-11-15.I returned first idol 3 and got replacement because double tap didn't work. And now on the replacement, double tap still barely works. It taps off but doesn't always tap back on. This is the reason i returned the first phone. I can't be only one having this issue. Other than that, good phone for now.***update 9-13-15***After months of use, I'm returning for galaxy s4. Thanks amazon for letting me. The idol, as much as I wanted to like and keep, is too slow and laggy and is sometimes unresponsive. Double tap on and off decides on its own when it wants to work, I hit call button twice sometimes because it doesn't respond the first time I try and the swype to text on the phone doesn't work well; it's as if my finger gets caught up/stuck on the screen and it doesn't make the word or forms incorrect word.Its just too slow and unresponsive for me. When I clear the screens with button on bottom right, the slowness shows as the framerate is horribly choppy. Plus the battery is built in. My new s4 has a removeable battery.The things I liked were speakers in front and screen, but the slowness and unresponsive nature of device made me switch.","907","Alcatel","2"

"1445","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","Ok so a lot of people have the following needs for a phone: using email, web browsing, listening to music, texting/making calls, casual game playing. A lot of those people buy $700 phones to just meet those needs. The alcatel idol 3 is a fraction of that cost without any compromises in those areas. It looks feels and sounds like a classy flagship. It doesnt have the tech horse power of a 700 dollar phone, meaning if you do a lot of multitasking and high-end gaming then this probably isnt your best choice. But iv seen a lot of people mention minor lag and i can say: in terms of basic normal use there is no lag what so ever. If youre looking for something that can dazzle on a budget for the average user, this will deliver. I do wonder about the durability in the long run. The screen sits on top of the device in a way that makes me think its probably not the hardest thing to break. If youre a person that likes to go case-less, i would probably consider going with a case here. But so far i have no reasons to complain. This is a cool phone, and when you factor in the price, its a really cool phone.","907","Alcatel","2"

Overall I think it's a good package for the price. Three problems I have which may warrant its return are the fact that I can't get a LTE Signal on StraightTalk (AT&T Network - could be SIM card related; still investigating), can't get it to pair with my 2012 Ford F-150 Sync System (non-touch screen version) and can't get the swipe function on the keyboard to work. A vivid, bright screen, decent speakers and low price can't make up for basic functionality I rely on everyday. I'll mess around with it some more but will likely return if I can't get these features to work. I'm coming from a Google/LG Nexus 4 that took a bath in a lake and I'm missing that phone already. I do find the Idol 3 to have more lag than my Nexus 4, which was running KitKat, not Lollipop.Update: Turned out that the Bluetooth pairing problem was on the Sync end. Following a master reset of Sync the phone paired effortlessly for both phone and media audio. Haven't tried text to speech yet though. I downloaded the Google Keyboard app and swipe function has been restored. Apparently it is a well documented issue that the stock keyboard app doesn't support swipe gestures. I've upped the review to 4-stars. A little more processing performance & less lag would garner a 5 star rating.","907","Alcatel","2"

The phone can't compete with the top flagship phones today, but for its price, you can't really complain. Phone is nicely designed and it is almost as thin as a iphone 6+. Phone has a beautiful display and loud speakers that you can compete with the flagship phones today. That's where the difference ends. It has a slower snapdragon 615 cpu 2gigs of memory, no removable battery, nfc and wireless/quick charge. One design quirk that I don't like is the placement of the power and volume rocker. Most phones has power button to the right and volume rockers to the left, this is just the opposite. Not to mention that the power button is so high up in the phone. The phone looks nice but not very well protected so you should definitely get a case for it. Software is Lollipop 5.0.2 rather than 5.1.1 that other flagship offers. Although I can't complain about the almost stock android experience which works fine for me. You definitely need a micro sd card if you want to put movies and mp3's as I only have 7 gigs free without having any media files stored internally. I hope that Alcatel can offer software updates like what the other flagship phones does.Should you get this phone, yes, but I would wait for Alcatel phone goes on sale as I brought mine for less than $200.Pro's- Has a beautiful 1080p display.- Very nice stereo speakers- FM tuner- Band 12 LTE for t-mobile phones- Nice, nice and thin design while maintaining a 2915 mah battery.Cons- Placement of power and volume rockers- Slower Snapdragon 615 cpu with 2 gigs of memory.- No NFC, wireless and quick charging- Android 5.0.2 rather than 5.1.1","907","Alcatel","2"

The screen is just amazing, the best screen I've seen on a phone. It's vibrant and bright (even in bright sunlight). I really hope the next version has more RAM and a better camera. The current camera is good but nothing to write home about. It's definitely better than the nexus 5 (2013) and the moto g and it's not fair to compare it to flagship phones. The speakers are ridiculously good (stereo too!!). It comes with JBL headsets, which are way better than the other standard headsets you get these days (if you're lucky to get one that is). The screen size is great. The next model should definitely have quick charge, a bigger battery (even though the current one lasts almost 12 hours on medium-high use and at 70% brightness, this includes watching videos, listening to music a lot and reading articles every hour). The SD card is a huge advantage, seriously this phone is a winner. Also, the most important part, it's pretty much stock Android!!! Which is really the star of the show here.

I shopped around for a budget-priced phone with up to date specs. I spent days on this, and decided on this phone because it was $100 less than I was willing to spend but it still had everything I needed. My only concern at purchase was I thought battery life would be an issue coming off a phone with a 5000 MaH battery I had with the BLU Studio Energy 2. What I do is go into settings and turn on battery saver immediately after taking the phone off the charger. That way I get about 18 hours of fairly active use, calling, texting, streaming video, listening to audio. Then I put on charger and am ready for the next day. It has a 2950 MaH battery but lasts more like a 4000 MaH one on battery saver mode. Phone is super fast with octa-core processor, even running on battery saver - I can't really tell the difference in performance, but it's limiting the background processes that drain the juice out of most phones. Phone ships with Android 5.1, but it quickly upgrades to the newer Android Marshmallow 6.0 software upon initial bootup. Also, phone has an 8MP selfie camera, 5MP is standard on many phones which is ice. The front camera is decent at 13MP, on par with a Samsung S6. Nice display and beautiful video. At 5.5"" it's the right size and the build quality is impressive. Good sound from the JBL twin speakers, you can actually hear. Call quality seems to be good (I'm on Cricket), and the speakerphone comes in loud and clear. It even comes with NFC built-in if that's important to you. Overall, it's a 5-star phone at a 3-star price point and it has my highest recommendation.","907","Alcatel","2"

If that goes well and this are better, then I'll consider bumping the star rating back up to 4 stars....Original Review follows, and all of these things are still true for me. I do really love what this phone got right, its just too bad its not constructed better...Here are a few thing that should make you want this phone:* The Camera app - Alcatel seems to have made their own camera app, and do not use the Android stock app (which if you want you could install from the app store). But this app I feel like is superior to the android one. It does virtually no hunting for focus, and takes photos immediately when you press the shutter button. I feel like this gives the camera a distinctly Apple Iphone feel to it, and have been pleasantly surprised. The Google Camera app does not function as smoothly, and am glad to have an alternative with the Alcatel. Others have commented on the actual camera photo quality itself, which I have not tested, but honestly for my use I'm glad that the app just functions fast.* The phone is pretty much stock android. I put the Google Now Launcher on my phone and the experience is almost exactly the same as my old Nexus 4. There are a few pre-loaded apps, but you can easily remove them. The ones that you can't remove are system apps like the android gallery, and the Mix application which is a music player. Both can be ignored for your applications of choice.With that said, other reviews have done a good job of describing the phone and its pros and cons. I just wanted to add the only reason I can't give it a 5, is that while it is awesome for the price, it still has its drawbacks. It does so many things great, and they got many features totally right. But after using it for 4 or 5 days, I begin to notice the areas where they had to cut corners to get it to the price it is at. These things have been mentioned in other reviews already. With that said. Its amazing how much they do for the price, but they haven't quite hidden the reasons you might want a more expensive phone, in my opinion. If you're already in the market for spending this much, instead of buying something much more expensive, then I can say you should definitely just buy it and try it out.","907","Alcatel","2"

"1487","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","4","I moved from a Note II (T-Mobile) to this Idol 3. I got tired of carrying around a phone that had extra weight and size due to a stylus I never used. I got in on the original pre-order price of $200 and decided to give it a try. I have had the phone a little over a week and would like to run down some of my thoughts.- I like the screen, it is clear and bright and I don’t find myself missing my AMOLED from my Note II.- The screen is very visible in direct sunlight, way better than my Note II, wife’s S3 or G2.- I do not mind the left side power button (I’m left handed) but it takes some getting used to.- Regarding the above I am aware the phone has a double tap to wake/sleep function however I have found it very inconsistent. My wife’s G2 is much more consistent, I would say hers works 95% of the time and this about 50% (to wake, to sleep is much more consistent). I sent an email to Alcatel and they claim they are aware of this issue and plan on addressing it in an update.- It is very light and easy to use with my “medium” sized guy hands.- Case selection is somewhat limited.- It works well with T-Mobile, I get LTE where I did with my Note II and have no issue with wifi, Bluetooth or GPS. I do miss the stock T-Mobile voicemail app (the play store one is buggy).- The camera is quick to focus and takes pretty good photos. Video is good as well. I consider it as good as the one I had on my Note II (I liked that camera).- I like that it is not cluttered with bloat wear. My T-Mobile branded phone was loaded with all kinds of app’s I could not remove. I think this lends to the phone’s efficient use of resources.- Battery life has been good so far, I get through a day. I am a bit apprehensive about the lack of a replaceable battery. I always like the idea of being able to replace/swap mine on my Note II.6/12/15 Update -- The lowest setting for volume for the notifications is way to loud. There are plenty of apps to ""boost"" volume but I can not find a good one for a work around here.- I have not been get 5ish hours of screen on time as many reviewers state. I usually get to about 4 with about 10% battery left. I am not a heavy gamer. Just email, reading web pages and texting. A smattering of clash of clans here and there.","907","Alcatel","2"

And so you might think I would be delighted that I got such a 'good' deal, right? WRONG. I am extremely disappointed with this phone, despite my previous research and finding many good reviews on it.I have an LG41C with no special bells and whistles, though it pretty much has everything I really need. But after almost two years, it's got a couple of glitches that can't be resolved so I thought I would ""upgrade"" to another brand and a larger size. What a mistake!This Alcatel takes 45 + seconds to start fully (my LG takes 20), it takes only adequate photos (my LG takes GREAT pics), the battery runs almost out after only a few hours of little to no usage and with power save on - plus I haven't even talked on this phone yet! (my LG runs hours longer and I occasionally talk on it), and this Alcatel takes HOURS to fully charge (my LG takes an hour at most and that's if it's under 10%). AND while it's charging (power off) it makes a low buzzing sound about every 15 seconds and there is NO way to stop it.In addtion to all that - I cannot open photos on messaging and despite confirming that all the settings are correct. I tried everything possible and then called Alcatel and was actually told that the messaging that is built into this phone is not the best and you can't receive MMS! What? My LG has always opened photos via its built-in messaging, as long as mobile data is enabled. So the Alcatel rep told me to use another messaging app in order to open photos. Unacceptable.And not only all that, it will NOT sound a notification upon receipt of text messages. Again, I have worked with all the appropriate settings (I'm not a novice) over and over and it simply will not work.Also, there are no emojis available on the keypad when you're using Instagram. Huh?I've no doubt there are multiple other problems with this phone that I've never even encountered yet - but in the two weeks that I've used it, these are quite enough problems.And now . . . this is the worst:In the past couple of days, this Alcatel gets VERY HOT during charging (my LG NEVER gets hot when charging, not even in the slightest) - and this heating issue alone is why I am going to send it back because I fear it is potentially dangerous. A phone simply should NOT get this hot while charging.Everyone has their own opinion and can make their own decision - but I would NOT recommend this phone to anyone and I am appalled that this $99 phone (not even worth that) is NOW listed at such a ridiculous price of $240.","907","Alcatel","2"

At least a 3000mAh bettary7. Expandable storage or a 64GB storage with a reasonable price8. Quick charger availableWhat I don't like about my idol 3:1. The JBL earbuds are those deep in-ear type which I don't like at all. It feels very uncomfortable to me to put anything deep inside of my ears. I know those deep in-ear headphones are very popular right now, but I really don't like them. This is not a big issue since I have earbuds from Apple and Motorola and I usually use my AKG and Sony headbands to listen to music.2. There is a lag sometimes while using the phone. This is not a big problem except when playing music which really bothers me.

Overall, I found it to be a great deal. The screen and battery life were great, the processor snappy, and the camera good for the price range.Unfortunately, after 6 months, I pulled my Alcatel Idol 3 out of my pocket and the screen was cracked. It had not been struck by anything, as you can see from the photo below. The crack comes from the edge, and there is no physical damage there. When I called Alcatel and they told me the warranty does not cover 'physical damage' and that a cracked screen counts as 'physical damage' no matter what.Maybe my phone was defective an Alcatel simply didn't want to cover my warranty. Otherwise, I gotta say, ONLY BUY THIS PHONE IF YOU PLAN TO BE VERY GENTLE WITH IT!!! (I had mine in a protective case).I ended up with a Moto G 3. It isn't quite as good as the Alcatel Idol 3 as far as screen goes, but what is the use of a phone that is slightly better if it is liable to break and Alcatel won't cover it? It is not worth the $200+ dollar risk.Again, hopefully for others, my phone was just defective.","907","Alcatel","2"

I wouldn't have mentioned this as a negative point considering the phone price point but I have a Blu phone that cost less than this phone and that phone is much faster.In short if you are looking for a phone with good stereo speakers and nice display but don't mind putting a screen protector and a bulky case for the phone, this would be a good fit.

"1523","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","3","I've had this phone for a couple of days now; I wanted something with a bigger screen, but without having to spend the eight or nine hundred bucks it would have cost to stay in the iPhone family. My overall cost for this phone and a 64 GB microSD card was about 1/4 the cost of an iPhone 6S Plus.Getting the phone set up was mostly simple—I checked for and installed the Android system updates while charging the phone, then put in the microSD and SIM cards. (The SIM card was kind of a pain, since an adapter was necessary, but once I discovered that the adapter I ordered did include a thin strip of tape to make sure the SIM card doesn't fall out (which was not mentioned anywhere on the package), all went smoothly.)The parts I like, so far:• the expandable storage/memory. I may replace the 64 GB card with a 128 GB card at some point, but it'll be more than enough for now. I'm just happy to no longer be limited to the phone's built-in storage.• the large screen and full HD (1080 x 1920) resolution. Text is very readable, even at the ""normal"" setting, and there's plenty of room for whatever I'm looking at. Images generally look sharp and smooth, without jagginess.• the ""double tap"" feature. Double tap to wake the phone, then double tap to put it to sleep again. Very convenient—especially given the phone's reversible feature. Caveat: it does not work with the lock screen. In that instance, the power button has to be used to put the phone back to sleep.• the reversible feature. I'm surprised more phones don't do this. When the feature is enabled, the display orients itself to the way you are holding the phone. Not only that, but the earpiece and microphones switch as well, so the phone is always right side up, even when holding it upside down.• the battery life. So far, the battery life seems very good. The phone did charge a little bit between the time I transferred some photos to my computer and the time I unplugged the USB cable; otherwise, the battery is currently at 39% since its first full charge two nights ago.• the ""sweep"" feature (or whatever it is called), which enables you to close all open apps at once. Very convenient.• the phone is light. Despite being significantly larger than my old iPhone 5 (the display on this phone by itself is bigger than the iPhone 5 in a case), the Idol 3 is lighter than the iPhone 5. I don't think it's a huge difference, but it's definitely enough to notice.• the stereo speakers. The speakers sound good—and they sound just as good whether the phone is facing up or down (even in the simple case I bought for it).• the unlocked phone is upgradable to Marshmallow 6.0.1. (My carrier offers the Idol 3, but there's no indication of the Marshmallow upgrade being available from them anytime soon. Otherwise, I would have gone through them.)There are a couple of things I'm not so keen on at the moment:• the placement of the buttons. Though on opposite sides, the power and volume buttons are placed at about the same level; I have already taken several inadvertent screenshots while trying to put the phone to sleep from the lock screen.• the camera. It may be a matter of getting used to it, but the camera does not appear to live up to the quality of the display. Colors seem a bit washed out, especially with the front camera. Also, the front camera offers only automatic exposure, whereas the back camera offers full manual. UPDATE (8/20/16): The manual mode is useless. You can adjust ISO, shutter speed, and focus (!), but all you'll get is a black image—yup, no picture whatsoever. Only the automatic exposure mode will work. In addition, the panoramic mode does a poor job; you WILL end up with jagged edges at the least, and probably even sections where the image is not stitched together properly. In any event, in all but the best lighting conditions, your images will be noisy, with some blockiness apparent, and plenty of chroma noise. If you already have a phone that takes decent photos, you'll want to hang onto it; either that, or use a real camera.• if you use a PIN to unlock your phone, Android requires you to press a ""check"" key after the number. Not a huge deal, but iOS unlocks the phone as soon as you've pressed that last digit, so I sometimes forget, and the phone goes back to sleep.• unlike the iPhone, this phone doesn't read the SIM card until after the rather lengthy splash screen animation has finished. So, whereas the iPhone will show the name of the carrier and signal strength as soon as you've unlocked the phone, the Idol 3 shows ""No SIM Card"", and then ""No SIM Card – [carrier]"" before the name of the carrier appears. This always gives me pause, particularly since I have a nano SIM and had to use an adapter. Also unlike the iPhone, the display does not show the name of the carrier all the time—but that can be easily verified in the Quick Setting panel. (I mean, I know who my carrier is; I just like to know that the telephony function of the phone is working properly.)As for the quality of phone calls, I haven't used it long enough, but the first call I made sounded okay. At this point, I would probably give the iPhone a slight edge in sound quality.I haven't tried the earbuds yet, but then I rarely use my phone to listen to music, so this isn't much of a concern for me.(A note about the packaging: because they've hidden it under the lid covering the compartments of the box that contain the USB cable, charger, and earbuds, the tool used to open the card holder is very easy to miss. I had already used the one that came with the SIM card adapter I bought at the same time as the phone when I finally noticed it was there.)Apart from a few hiccups that go with getting used to a new OS, I am liking the Idol 3 so far. It's a light phone with a great display, good sound, and good battery life, and I didn't have to spend an exorbitant amount of money to get it.","907","Alcatel","2"

I have to stifle the impulse to say I am amazed at the quality and usefulness of this device.I bought it with Android 5.0 1 and recently it updated - 6.01. I didn't know it would do that! It was a bonus.My only problem is the 16 gigabytes. The Android operating system does not use the SD card efficiently, and so I had problems with filling your memory with too many apps and data. This is not a problem with the phone but more a problem with the operating system. Although if the phone has more memory that would have been a solution for me.This phone has been a joy for me and I would recommend to anyone!","907","Alcatel","2"

I splurge on the latest new device, only to regret it for some reason or another. Sold my Moto G because the camera was terrible, sold my Note 4 because I think having a $700 phone is ridiculous.Wanted LTE band 12 (T-Mobile is building out their network coverage in rural areas especially with this frequency not supported yet by many phones), a big screen, dual band WiFi, and a price under $300.Initially passed over this phone and Alcatel altogether because it seemed like a very low end brand. This device has changed my opinion of the company. I also looked at the zte zmax and huawei p8 lite, but this Idol 3 seemed to be the best combination of affordability and features.Very customizable and near stock Android lollipop. Great screen, great speakers, decent build quality, decent main camera (seems about as good as my old S4 which was fine), above average front facing camera. Too bad it doesnt have a replaceable battery, but not a huge deal. Doesnt seem like an octa core processor, lagging at times, although not enough to annoy.I usually install custom software on my phones, but after using this phone for a while, turning off double tap to wake, and uninstalling almost all of the preinstalled apps, I like it the way it is.Because it was cheap for a smartphone, I won't be devastated if it gets dropped or cracked. Turn off double tap to wake, uninstall unwanted apps, install a different launcher if you want, install Google keyboard, be careful installing the sim card, dont expect it to behave like a $700 Note 4, and enjoy!","907","Alcatel","2"

Not sure how I sounded to others but on my end voice quality sounded hollow and tinny and whatever I was listening to kept fading in and out. Pretty sure it was the phone because my cheaper back-up phone doesn't have those issues. I eventually decided to return the phone for a refund. I think a better choice, in the same price range, would be the Huawei Ascend Mate 2. Bigger screen and killer battery life. For something cheaper go with BLU.","907","Alcatel","2"

At first flush, the OneTouch Idol 3 is an amazing phone. It's a beautiful phone, and it's internal components are first-rate. I never had better speeds on the T-Mobile network. It seems like a great phone, and the price cannot be beat for what you get.However, this is a one star review for a reason. The phone has one dramatic flaw is only noticeable after a few months of ownership. And it's a flaw that renders the phone unusable. To keep the price down, Alcatel did not use Gorilla Glass for the big and beautiful screen. It's probably how they kept the price of this phone so low. This and this alone is a reason to look elsewhere for your next phone. All it takes is a small drop or accidentally sitting on the phone to crack the glass. And it doesn't just crack, it shatters like a window pane.The glass will shatter even if you have the phone in a hard case, which is what happened to me (twice, with two different phones). Sadly, this is a known issue and Alcatel will not replace your phone, even under warranty.","907","Alcatel","2"

I hadn't had any real problems out of it except for when it did not wake up at one time. I tapped, I pressed the power button and I even called it, mind you this was after the most recent update. I ended up having to do a hard reset on it, so far no further problems. The only thing that I don't like is that you don't have access to emojis on social media but other than its a very good phone definitely worth $250 bucks.UPDATE!!!!!!!Well I have had this phone for a while now and I loved it, the only problems Ive had with this phone are ones that Ive caused myself, as far as the phone messing up on its own, no problems. The worst thing about this phone is the screen is not durable at all, one tap against a chair and it cracks and the screen does not work, cant unlock it, cant do anything, my galaxy s3 is way more durable than this. I recommend getting a tempered glass protector for it and the most durable case you can, but generally as long as you have the tempered glass you can just about use any case you would like. Ive searched all over for a phone that might compare to this, tired of Samsung products and their UI and notification sounds, to poor for anything else that I might genuinely like, ran across the HONOR 5X but it doesnt have a reversible interface and it hasnt been released yet, I'm not patient enough to wait a couple months for reviews so I figure I will just order this again, Win WIn.","907","Alcatel","2"

This phone sounds better than a lot of the flagships out there. The speaker and headset port produce some great sound. This phone easily competes with all the flagships in the audio category and beats if not all than most.GPS, alcatel got it right, it's so hard to find an android phone with flawless gps performance. This phone locks on in quickly and is pretty accurate, the moto g is pretty good in this regard as well. My galaxy s6 ($600 phone) has issues with gps performance.Battery: You can easily make it through the day again this beats my s6 but not as good as a note 4. For the price it beats a lot of flagships in the battery category.What I don't like (mostly software issues)Cell reception: It's worse than my old galaxy s4, s6, and note. I can easily get lte on my other phones and this phone barely gets HDSPA. Sometimes drops to edge. The download speed is slower. But what annoys me the most is when I'm in a good area and the phone sticks on hdspa and doesn't switch to lte. I noticed that this happens much more often when my radio is set to lte/wcdma/gsm more than lte/wcdma. So I have to manually switch it by going into the test settings through dial codes.Brightness: For some reason randomly the phone will dim all the way randomly, even with auto brightness turned off, me being outside, and the display set to full brightness. Which can make following directions or reading something outside very annoying.Background audio: Sometimes when I watched a youtube video put it on pause and turned off the display. Get a notification and the youtube video starts playing with the screen still off. It's annoying, and another software bug. Youtube isn't the only application to do this, for me most applications do this.Double tap: Turn it off, too many butt dials with the feature turned on.So great hardware, but there are some software issues, I'm checking for updates every day. I really want to keep this device. But my old cheaper moto g didn't have any of these issues. I think alcatel has a great device but for some reason way too many software bugs that needed to be ironed out before launch.","907","Alcatel","2"

I found it to be slow,on ATT and the tap to wake doesn't work all the time sometime when you make a long distance call and try to hit speaker phone the phone goes black or you loss the call. I will try to keep several more days to see if an update is going to solve some of the issues if not Iam going back to the LG G4. I realize that you get what you pay for but not at the risk of losing calls from fam.

I have had a few other phones in the last couple years, and I always prefer stock Android to other heavily modded UIs. I don't know why other companies think they can improve on something I am sure Google spent a lot of time developing...Pros- UI- The reversible speaker and home screen. I prefer having the headphone jack at the bottom when listening to music.- ScreenCons- My only complaint is that the double tap on feature doesn't work consistently. I think this has to do with the lock screen being engaged or not, or possibly how long the device has been asleep. I hope they fix it in the next few","907","Alcatel","2"

Will update over time.Update 7-11-15.I returned first idol 3 and got replacement because double tap didn't work. And now on the replacement, double tap still barely works. It taps off but doesn't always tap back on. This is the reason i returned the first phone. I can't be only one having this issue. Other than that, good phone for now.***update 9-13-15***After months of use, I'm returning for galaxy s4. Thanks amazon for letting me. The idol, as much as I wanted to like and keep, is too slow and laggy and is sometimes unresponsive. Double tap on and off decides on its own when it wants to work, I hit call button twice sometimes because it doesn't respond the first time I try and the swype to text on the phone doesn't work well; it's as if my finger gets caught up/stuck on the screen and it doesn't make the word or forms incorrect word.Its just too slow and unresponsive for me. When I clear the screens with button on bottom right, the slowness shows as the framerate is horribly choppy. Plus the battery is built in.

"1567","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","So far, a great phone. I did a lot of research when deciding on a new phone in this price range. I listen to a lot of music on the run and the tipping point in favor of the Idol 3, for me, was the front facing stereo speakers.I've had the phone for a few days now, and I'm very impressed with it. The user interface is pretty much stock Lollipop, which I really appreciate. There is very little bloatware/shovelware taking up memory and what there is can be easily removed. The camera is average and takes decent pictures under the right conditions. Bluetooth paired up with all my devices, even the more finicky devices that have given me fits in the past. Call quality is really good and the voices are clear on both ends. Signal reception has been the same as my old phone and I have had no issues connecting to the network. WIFI connections are as expected and I have had no issues.I dropped in a 128Gb micro SD card and it is working as expected. I haven't had a chance to test out the NFC connection, but It's nice to have this capability.The real shocker is the sound quality. The front facing stereo speakers are really impressive. They are loud and you can crank it up with no distortion. Everyone I've demo'ed this for has had the same reaction, ""Whoa, that is impressive"". Are you going to replace your home sound system? Of course not, But you get some pretty big sound from some pretty small speakers. The other surprise was from the included ear buds. I wasn't expecting much, but they sound pretty good for being included in the box. They have flat, no tangle cables and include different size ear pieces. They are a little flat sounding in the mid range, but not objectionably so. They won't replace my more expensive ear buds, but if these were the only ones I had, I'm not sure I would be that quick to replace them. I definitely won't be throwing these out.All in all I am very happy with this phone. It has great features and the sounds is incredible. On top of all that it functions well as a phone. In my opinion, this is a good value for the money.","907","Alcatel","2"
"1568","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","3","I""m giving this phone a 3 because there seems to be (for me) a fundamental flaw in the ergonomics of the phone. The way the switches are set up they are never in the right place. Also, I seem to be constantly grabbing the phone and hitting the switches at the same time, which seems to try and shut the phone down, or take a screenshot of the phone, neither of which I like. It took me a while to figure out that when I was trying to shoot a photo I was gripping the phone in a manner that I hit the buttons and it kept shutting down.I've had similar android phones and never had this issue.The icons are cartoon-y (I put an icon pack in to create shortcuts so I didn't have to look at them) and the phone seems rather slow to respond (for example, when you change screens or shut down the open apps). The phone seems to work ok, when I'm not having trouble manipulating it, and the setup was relatively simple and straightforward (coming from another unlocked android).I would not buy the phone again, but will keep it for now as I don't want the hassle of getting another phone.

Both phones look great. Both handle 4g LTE well.Side by side comparison of the two:1) the IDOL3 got better and more premium sound for enjoying the movies/games than ZenPone 2.2) However, ZenPhone 2 got much faster responses in all apps comparing to IDOL 3. If you need to do multitasking and use business apps, I will choose ZenPhone 2, but not IDOL 3.3) Regarding the talk quality, ZenPhone 2 is better than IDOL 3!4) ZenPhone 2 is heavier than IDOL 3 and solidly build. In contrast, IDOL 3 is much lighter and more like a jewelry and prone to break.Both are good phones.Personally, I favor ASUS ZenPhone 2 than IDOL3 for its Two Sim capability/Faster responses/Easily handling the multitasking for my daily business usage. However, if you only need a phone for entrainment, than IDOL 3 is a better choice than ZenPhone 2 for its much better speaker sounds (but not for the talking quality). As a T mobile user in both phones, I found Zenfone 2 had a better talking quality than IDOL 3.","907","Alcatel","2"

"1573","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","I lucked out and was able to buy the Idol 3 for $199 shortly before midnight on Amazon’s Prime Day blow-out. I gotta say, Alcatel did an exceptional design job on the Idol 3. I believe it’s the best value smartphone on the market.Pros:- Superb screen. Easy to use in bright sunlight, which makes picture taking a breeze on a sunny day.- JBL sound, through both the speakers and the headset, is outstanding. The included JBL headphones are excellent with clear mids & highs and distortion-free tight bass.- The build quality on this phone is exceptional. Feels good in your hands, with no hint of cheapness, flimsiness, or low quality material Buttons presses are firm and manufacturing seams are aligned and tight. It’s also remarkably light and thin.- Before I got the phone I thought the reversible user interface (UI) was something that, although slick, I doubted I’d use very much. On the contrary, being able to reverse the UI comes in pretty handy and I use it quite a lot. For instance, sometimes it’s convenient to have headphones plugged into the top of the phone, and other times it’s better for me to have the cord coming out of the bottom (like on my dashboard car mount). With the reversible screen that’s not an issue.- I love the the double-tap feature. Super convenient, particularly in the car. However, it can occasionally be inconsistent. (see “Cons” below).- Volume & Power button placement: A lot of reviewers dislike the placement of the vol and power buttons because they’re located high on the phone’s sides. However, I actually prefer this button placement because: a) as I’m holding or carrying the phone, I’m not constantly hitting the buttons, and, b) in my car, it allows me to put the phone in my dashboard car mount such that the mount’s clamp is not pressing the buttons.- Call quality: Call quality is good. I hear no distortion or tinny-ness.- Overall processor performance: I’m not a big-time power user or gamer, so the Idol 3 performs reliably and predictably for me. Occasionally I do experience a slight stutter, but it’s so minor that it’s no big deal. Navigation around the UI is generally smooth and hiccup-free.- Camera: Picture quality stacks up nicely with other phones, some which cost a lot more. For all but the most demanding needs, the Idol 3 will deliver crisp, focused shots with good color balance. I have not used it much in low light, so I can’t comment on that aspect.- GPS locks on quickly, and Wi-Fi connects reliably.- Battery life: the Idol 3’s battery life is a dream compared to my old HTC Inspire, which I had to recharge throughout a typical workday. I’m easily getting thru my workday with charge to spare. The battery charges quickly too, due to the 2amp wall charger.Cons:- An occasional UI stutter, as mentioned above.- The volume sliders can only be set to 8 incremental, discrete intervals; I wish the volume sliders were continuously variable (like the brightness slider).- The Idol 3’s vibration mode is very weak. If the phone is set to vibrate mode and it’s laying on my desk, I often cannot detect when a vibrating call or text is coming in.- If you have the double-tap feature enabled, you sometimes have to repeatedly double-tap in order to wake the screen up, particularly when it’s been asleep for an extended period.- This is big phone and will take a bit of getting used to if you have smaller hands. Although, I must say it’s nicely balanced. I have med/large hands and didn’t find the Idol 3 particularly slippery or hard to grip.- The user manual is not very comprehensive. Tech support is located in Guadalajara, Mexico. I called tech support to address a few questions I had; the support I received was of average competence, … not terrible but not great.In Conclusion:The overall performance of the Idol 3 at the $249 price point is outstanding. It’s half the price of, say, an LG G4, and side-by-side, stacks up nicely. The phone does everything I ask of it and then some. Call quality is good, the speakers kick some serious butt, the screen resolution and brightness are superb, the camera works great for me, and battery life is excellent. Unless you just have to have top-tier specs, this is the best “bang for the buck” smartphone on the market.","907","Alcatel","2"

The very bright and sharp display is easy to read in sunlight, the sound is as clear and loud as I've ever seen in a smartphone. Was worried that the 5.5"" screen would feel too big in my hand, but it actually fits well in my hand. The power button placement is a little high on the left side, but I've already gotten used to it. 4G LTE reception with Cricket Wireless has been solid, and I get a full day of battery life, even with a few hours of screen time. The phone feels thin and light but still feels solid.

"1586","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","I have had the phone for a week now and here is my honest opinion. As you see, that I have given the phone 5 stars. This rating is for comparison to other phones in it's price range. I am not going to try and compare this phone with IPhone or Samsung. I have T-Mobile and I am on a no-contract employee plan that requires me to buy my phones outright. So price is a BIG deal. IMO the phone is great! Here are my honest thoughts:- Screen Size and looks is great! Very readable in the sun. Well above it's $250 price tag- The ONLY lag I ever experience is when I am sweeping running apps. And that is hardly a lag. It is very fluid and responsive.- No Dropped Calls- My LTE T-Mobile data has been 12.5 mbps- Front facings speakers are amazing and sound great. BUT they are louder than I want them to be at the lowest setting. I have Triplets Babies and when they are asleep, I can't have headphones in and the audio on the lowest setting is still too loud.- The Camera is Great! No issues or complaints.- The double tap to turn it on is unreliable and works less than 50% of the time. Double tapping to turn off works just fine.- BUT I am right handed and I have no issues with where the on/off button is. I don't know why others have complained.- I love the I can talk into either end of the phone. Especially when using the google search. It hears me every time!- The GPS is great and on-time! The front facing speakers were great to hear the turn by turn directions.- The head phones sound great!- The reversible setting is awesome and such a duh idea.- This may be an Android problem but is really annoying… but any group messaging that I have gets a date of Jan 17, 1970 and so they just sit at the bottom of my messages log. It’s VERY Annoying and I can’t figure out how to fix that. Anyone else have this problem?- Battery Life is about a day in a half. I use my phone mostly with Calls, Texts, Twitter, Facebook, Email, Camera, Internet. (Occasionally the GPS and Netflix, no gaming.)- In all, the phone is not ""perfect"". But just as close as it's going to be at this price. Definitely worth 5 stars and I recommend it every time!Now I just need a case. Not a bulky one. Any recommendations?","907","Alcatel","2"

Low light is not excellent but, again, for the price, very nice.Expandable memory: Has a double slot for Sim and micro SD card. Even my Moto X didn't do that.Battery: Makes it through the whole day with moderately heavy use. You can kill it if you try hard enough but I usually have half a charge left after a long day.Minuses: There appears to be no way to stop ""full battery"" notifications. If you have it by your bed at night, it is annoying to be notified of a full battery at 3AM.Speed: While adequate, there is some lag with multiple applications open.

I shopped around for a budget-priced phone with up to date specs. I spent days on this, and decided on this phone because it was $100 less than I was willing to spend but it still had everything I needed. My only concern at purchase was I thought battery life would be an issue coming off a phone with a 5000 MaH battery I had with the BLU Studio Energy 2. What I do is go into settings and turn on battery saver immediately after taking the phone off the charger. That way I get about 18 hours of fairly active use, calling, texting, streaming video, listening to audio. Then I put on charger and am ready for the next day. It has a 2950 MaH battery but lasts more like a 4000 MaH one on battery saver mode. Phone is super fast with octa-core processor, even running on battery saver - I can't really tell the difference in performance, but it's limiting the background processes that drain the juice out of most phones. Phone ships with Android 5.1, but it quickly upgrades to the newer Android Marshmallow 6.0 software upon initial bootup. Also, phone has an 8MP selfie camera, 5MP is standard on many phones which is ice. The front camera is decent at 13MP, on par with a Samsung S6. Nice display and beautiful video. At 5.5"" it's the right size and the build quality is impressive. Good sound from the JBL twin speakers, you can actually hear. Call quality seems to be good (I'm on Cricket), and the speakerphone comes in loud and clear. It even comes with NFC built-in if that's important to you. Overall, it's a 5-star phone at a 3-star price point and it has my highest recommendation.","907","Alcatel","2"

"1596","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","This is the cheapest phone I've ever bought and one of the best I've ever had. Having used it constantly everyday for almost a month now I knew I had to review it.Let's start with the physical: The phone is thin with a sleek design comparable to some flagships out there. It is ultra lightweight to the point that I don't feel it in my purse; sometimes I actually rummage through my bag to make sure it's still there. The screen is big and pictures are clear and crisp. Same sound-wise, I haven't had any dropped calls or had people on the other end telling me they can't hear me so it's definitely a jump up from my last android which was more than double the price.Now the technical: To start with I purchased a 32gb SDHC card to take advantage of the expandable storage so I didn't have to skimp out on any apps I used, and as a long time T-Mobile customer I was able to get the SIM card for free. I immediately put the cards in and voila I had a working phone. [Disclaimer: There are no features from T-Mobile that I do not have access to, unless there are features out there that I am not aware of].So the important stuff, I am in love with the eye scanner (HOW COOL IS THAT) which can be used as a lock screen mechanism. It makes me feel like a secret spy agent! Unlike fingerprint readers which seem outdated now, I'm able to impress my friends and family with an eye scanner. I also very much enjoy the camera which pulls up with two presses of the power button, it beats tapping on a screen that isn't always responsive in a moment's notice. I can capture vital images quickly and accurately in a moving vehicle or when I'm at a concert, which is simply awesome especially for the price tag. Lastly, the fast charging nature of this phone puts me in awe. I use the phone for hours on end and yes the battery drains like a normal phone does, but then all I have to do is plug it in and my phone gets charged in no time! I can also keep playing my games, video chatting and having multiple apps and webpages open with no lag and without pausing to let the phone charge, and a regular car charger gets my phone charged even when I have Waze or Google Maps on.Overall I highly recommend this phone, if it somehow died I would buy another one without hesitation. This phone is comparable to flagships in terms of design and basic features one looks for in a phone. And for the price it truly is unbeatable without being inferior.","907","Alcatel","2"

I gave up on my search because I didn't get what I needed in a moderately priced android phone till I saw a friend with the 4.7 inch version of the idol 3. I browsed through and was like 'whaaat, Alcatel did this'? The phone fast, has a good camera, has good speakers and good battery life, because after about 30 minutes of watching videos, the battery didn't drain as it would've on my iPhone 6. I bought one of the 4.7 for my personal use due to its cute size and 4 of the 5.5 to sell. In my country, bigger screen phones sells faster, plus the 5.5 is the better of the two in terms of performance. It's been about a year now and none of the buyers has called to complain about anything.

Since the price had dropped significantly it was a steal. At under $200 this phone is a solid buy. So far it's up to Marshmallow, and has a great screen, great performance, and amazing dual front facing speakers. Battery like is solid and the added benefit of expandable storage with a very stock interface (after adding the Google launcher) are an added bonus. The only issue with this phone is the camera. It's slow, and in medium to low light blurring does occur. I expect this from a phone at this price, but if you have decent light and steady hands you can take average photos.","907","Alcatel","2"
"1620","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","3","Update December 30th, 2015:* I had to downgrade my rating to a 3 star because after 6 months of usage the phone is noticeably showing wear and tear of being a cheap phone. I had no illusion that the phone would be masterfully constructed at the price point. At this point I can feel that the phone creaks if bent a little bit, and I can see that my screen cover's glue has come off at one edge. To top this off the camera has failed me recently, and I'm in the process of submitting a warranty claim. If that goes well and this are better, then I'll consider bumping the star rating back up to 4 stars....Original Review follows, and all of these things are still true for me. I do really love what this phone got right, its just too bad its not constructed better...Here are a few thing that should make you want this phone:* The Camera app - Alcatel seems to have made their own camera app, and do not use the Android stock app (which if you want you could install from the app store). But this app I feel like is superior to the android one. It does virtually no hunting for focus, and takes photos immediately when you press the shutter button. I feel like this gives the camera a distinctly Apple Iphone feel to it, and have been pleasantly surprised. The Google Camera app does not function as smoothly, and am glad to have an alternative with the Alcatel. Others have commented on the actual camera photo quality itself, which I have not tested, but honestly for my use I'm glad that the app just functions fast.* The phone is pretty much stock android. I put the Google Now Launcher on my phone and the experience is almost exactly the same as my old Nexus 4. There are a few pre-loaded apps, but you can easily remove them. The ones that you can't remove are system apps like the android gallery, and the Mix application which is a music player. Both can be ignored for your applications of choice.With that said, other reviews have done a good job of describing the phone and its pros and cons. I just wanted to add the only reason I can't give it a 5, is that while it is awesome for the price, it still has its drawbacks. It does so many things great, and they got many features totally right. But after using it for 4 or 5 days, I begin to notice the areas where they had to cut corners to get it to the price it is at. These things have been mentioned in other reviews already. With that said. Its amazing how much they do for the price, but they haven't quite hidden the reasons you might want a more expensive phone, in my opinion. If you're already in the market for spending this much, instead of buying something much more expensive, then I can say you should definitely just buy it and try it out.","907","Alcatel","2"

I got tired of carrying around a phone that had extra weight and size due to a stylus I never used. I got in on the original pre-order price of $200 and decided to give it a try. I have had the phone a little over a week and would like to run down some of my thoughts.- I like the screen, it is clear and bright and I don’t find myself missing my AMOLED from my Note II.- The screen is very visible in direct sunlight, way better than my Note II, wife’s S3 or G2.- I do not mind the left side power button (I’m left handed) but it takes some getting used to.- Regarding the above I am aware the phone has a double tap to wake/sleep function however I have found it very inconsistent. My wife’s G2 is much more consistent, I would say hers works 95% of the time and this about 50% (to wake, to sleep is much more consistent). I sent an email to Alcatel and they claim they are aware of this issue and plan on addressing it in an update.- It is very light and easy to use with my “medium” sized guy hands.- Case selection is somewhat limited.- It works well with T-Mobile, I get LTE where I did with my Note II and have no issue with wifi, Bluetooth or GPS. I do miss the stock T-Mobile voicemail app (the play store one is buggy).- The camera is quick to focus and takes pretty good photos. Video is good as well. I consider it as good as the one I had on my Note II (I liked that camera).- I like that it is not cluttered with bloat wear. My T-Mobile branded phone was loaded with all kinds of app’s I could not remove. I think this lends to the phone’s efficient use of resources.- Battery life has been good so far, I get through a day. I am a bit apprehensive about the lack of a replaceable battery. I always like the idea of being able to replace/swap mine on my Note II.6/12/15 Update -- The lowest setting for volume for the notifications is way to loud. There are plenty of apps to ""boost"" volume but I can not find a good one for a work around here.- I have not been get 5ish hours of screen on time as many reviewers state. I usually get to about 4 with about 10% battery left. I am not a heavy gamer. Just email, reading web pages and texting. A smattering of clash of clans here and there.","907","Alcatel","2"

"1628","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","I decided to buy this phone on a whim after reading several early reviews. I'm glad I did. No, it's not perfect, but you have to consider what you get for your money. Other reviewers have gone into great detail about pros and cons so I won't repeat here. There are a few quirks, but in my opinion, the pros far outweigh the cons. I thought there was a problem with my external SD card when I couldn't access files on the card. It turned out my card was formatted in exFat. Once I formatted it to Fat32, all was well. When I was setting up my phone I somehow lost 2 screen panels and ended up with only one. I had to factory reset and that cured the problem. Also, sometimes the screen digitizer can be a little balky. The speakers are quite good as are the included earbuds. Maybe not as good as HTC's, but still good. The screen is very good for a phone at this price point. The camera was also a pleasant surprise. No, it won't beat the Galaxy S6 or iphone6, but you won't be disappointed either. I found no lag others have mentioned, but then again, I don't play games or launch multiple apps at once. For what I do, it was as smooth as butter. You will get through a day on the battery unless you are a heavy user. Unless you're a true perfectionist, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this phone when they consider it cost $250 for a no-contract, unlocked phone.","907","Alcatel","2"

If it costs more than 99 dollars I would send it back . I picked it up for a back up phone. I decided to give it a test drive. This phone isn't very powerful . I am going to give a review on what's important to me. 1. Signal. It's allover the place fading in from full bars to no bars of LTE . I discovered if I put it in hspa it's fairly stable . In areas that have a great LTE Signal It's fantastic. 2. Call quality. It's middle of the road not great , not horrible. The moto g4 plus is way better , but the g4 has VOLTE . The idol 3 doesnt.3, battery , it's a little better than okay . If I don't use it , it will last . If I do use it it is just like every other phone .4. Responsiveness. I have a galaxy s7 edge . I am used to touchwiz lag . This phone lags as much as my Samsung . I did change the settings in developer options. 5. Screen ..not bad its fairly bright. 6. Storage it's been updated to 6.1,1. It now has adaptive storage . Buy a good SD card if you are going to use it as adaptive storage.7. Size for 5.5 it feels pretty small and very light. I put a glass screen protector on and my favorite slim case. It feels and looks pretty nice.8. Emails and text they work well. I think if t-mobile didn't force Alcatel to disable band 12 (or if Alcatel paid for band 12 license this review would be better. All in all if you can grab it for 99$ do it. But for more go with the honor 5x or moto g4 . For some reason I like this phone .its over a year old now and still a decent performer .","907","Alcatel","2"

On a recent trip, I was amazed at how useful their phones were during our travel (Uber, Lyfte, AirBNB, Airline information, Maps) and decided I would get ready for my contract renewal in a few months, by getting a cheap smartphone and loading it up, via WIFI connection at home. Read the reviews and this one was priced at $99. Why not? It's been a week, and it has been eye-opening. It's replacing my clip on MP3 player, cause it plays MP4s as well. The sound is incredible. I have a 64 GB microSD with all my music, that I hot swap into the phone's dual slide. The slide has space for a microSD and a SIM card. I enjoy the built-in radio, Skyping, and using Viber on my WIFI. I've got apps to read Word and Excel documents, my G-mail updates...it goes on and on. It does take around 20 seconds to boot to a visible screen once you press the on button, and I think that may fool many into thinking the phone isn't working, as they repeating hit the on/off button. Just push on, and have patience. The OS also rebooted several times over the first few days, but after a week, that has finally stopped. Camera takes good pictures but not great. It's been fun, and I haven't even activated my phone yet. Once I do, and probably with Cricket, which uses AT&T towers, everything should be ready and I won't have a learning curve.","907","Alcatel","2"

"1652","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","For the price, the only device that can compare to this for the price is the zenfone 2. The zf2 has a more powerful processor, GPU and 2x the ram for $50 more. Even though I'm usually all about specifications on my devices, I don't play graphically intense games on my phone. (that's what a PC or console is for in my opinion) So I'll take the better screen, slimmer profile, almost completely stock version of Android and the dual JBL audio front facing speakers any day over the slight difference in performance.I've seen some reviews of people receiving units with a few annoying problems but I'm assuming those are either factory defects or refurbished units because I've had nothing but good experiences so far with mine.If I had to find something negative to say about this phone, I'd say the power button placement doesn't make sense at all even for a lefty. But the factory software does allow for double tap to wake and the display does rotate 180° in portrait which takes care of the button placement for the most part. The second thing is that I've noticed a few stutters here and there, and considering I came from a note 3 with the SD800, these slight stutters happen so infrequently that it doesn't bother me and I didn't really pay attention to them till I read about it in some reviews. Either way, I'm pretty sure this is because of the software optimization because other SD615 devices run smother. Hopefully an update to 5.1 or even marshmallow will cure this. If not, bootloader is already unlocked, root is her and there's already twrp available. Custom ROMs should be available soon too.","907","Alcatel","2"

I like to watch a lot of media so the beautiful big screen and dual front facing speakers is was sold me. The camera is not the best in the world, but more than enough for social media. You can take some real nice shots with it. All in all its a great phone!","907","Alcatel","2"

"1659","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","The size is perfect for average guy. It's large enough for typing w/ 2 thumbs, and small enough for use w/ one hand.The phone is light. So it doesn't bounce around in pants pocket.The battery life is good for a lite user. With cell data mostly off, I typically get 3-4 days.The case design allows secure fit for the soft shell, while exposing the forward facing speakers. Make sure to get a shell, or it might not survive a drop.The only downside is the SD card. It is in the same tray as the Sim card. When I take it out to transfer large files, sometimes it takes a few tries to get both cards aligned when inserting.","907","Alcatel","2"
"1660","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","First things first, this is not a perfect phone, but it is pretty damn close and factoring the price I got it for $99, this has been one of the better phones I have used recently. So long story short, broke my Nexus 6 and didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a new phone. I tried out a Sony Ultra C5, I didn’t like the screen at all, otherwise nice phone, so I sold it. Then I tried an LG G3 and it was a great phone but the GPS and camera were terrible. Finally I saw this phone on sale for $99 and figured why not?Well it was a great decision. This phone has been updated to Android 6.01 and everything runs well on it for the most part. This is not a fast phone, but it is a fast enough phone. I am able to browser this Internet, play emulators, and watch movies with ease. Again, it isn’t perfect but for $100, or around that price, it is an amazing value!Highlights:- Fast enough CPU/GPU (with occasional freezes/stuttering, but doesn't get too hot)- Expandable storage- Wonderful front facing speakers that can fill a small room with sound- Decent 1080p IPS LCD screen- Near stock android skin- Excellent all day (with moderate usage) battery life- Fantastic 8mp rear facing camera- Great audio quality with headphones- Surprisingly good call quality- Built in music app is fun and useful- NO BLOATWARELowlights:- Front facing camera is only average with poor low light performance- Multi Media messages like group texts, email texts, and photo texts don’t work on stock messaging app- CPU/GPU does stutter occasionally- Phone is a bit ungainly and slippery in hand for one-hand usagePro-tipsTo fix the MMS bug I mentioned about texts under lowlights, use a third party program off the Google Play Store such as Textra. Additionally, I disabled the “enhanced 4G LTE” setting on the phone and that seemed to help.As for the display, it is great for the price, but it tends to run a little on the “cooler” side in terms of color. You can adjust your color hue under settings. I personally bumped it up one on the color warmth and it looks significantly better. Furthermore, the phone display is extremely bright so things may look a little washed out. To fix this, find an area that is well lit (one that represents where you spend most of your day), and then slide the brightness all the way down, then slowly increase it until you find the colors have the right look about them. Personally, I have mine set to about 35-40% brightness. You can always flip the brightness to “auto” when you go into an extremely bright or dark area.","907","Alcatel","2"

The only thing really lacking is a gyroscope but for the price I can't really complain that it's missing. This is loaded with android 6.0.1, everything seems really snappy. This is the first phone I've used with soft keys and it's not bad. The front facing speakers are surprisingly good. However compared to my last phone the audio stream over blutooth is not as loud, meaning in my car I have to turn the dial up in order to have the same volume. I'd advise turning off the JBL special effects otherwise you'll end up with muddled music that is overly bassy, Although maybe you'll like it. The key is that you can atleast toggle this feature on or off depending on your taste.Pros:Nice screen sizePleasant designFront facing speakers sound really great (but will sound distorted at max volume)Speaker and microphone on both sides so you can answer/talk no matter which orientation you have the phone.Micro SD storageLong lasting batteryScreen will work in any orientation (nice for when you want to have the charging cable on the top vs bottom while in the car)Con:No gyroscope","907","Alcatel","2"

"1670","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","4","Just recieved the Idol 3 phone by Alcatel. I was a little sceptical about reading a lot of negative reviews about the camera on this phone, but I also own the Alcatel Pop One Touch, which takes very nice pictures usually without even using the flash! So, the first I did was to compare my old phone camera with the new one. I took the same pictures side by side, and this is what I found. Out of the box the new cameras exposure settings needed to be adjusted. If you click on the upper left of the camera screen, (there are three short lines), then choose settings--you will see exposure settings, click on the number 1 setting-- (Not -1). This will lighten up the screen for better picture taking. Under normal circumstances, you will not need a flash even inside your home! This will greatly improve your all around camera quality!! Hope it helps!! Great phone!","907","Alcatel","2"

"1673","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","5","This is a great phone for those of us who want a VERY nice, large screen, excellent battery life and don't need the fastest phone on the market. Yeah, it's slower than the Sammie S6 I got from work, but it isn't a long, painful wait for it to complete a task, just a slight hesitation. Unless you are a serious power user I doubt you'll have a problem with performance. The battery life is better than the S6. And it works as well as the Samsung as an actual phone (yes, I actually make calls on my phone... I'm old).The rear camera is fine... far better than my photography, that's for sure. I don't do selfies, so I don't know how well the front camera works (as indicated above, I'm old).The sound is MUCH better than the Samsung, both from the speaker and headphones, and the music program is easy to use and plays FLAC files.It is light enough that even with an armored case it isn't too heavy, and I quickly got used to the size. It is easier to carry on my belt, but it fits in my pocket. The S6 seems too small to me now, and I will almost certainly get another 5.5"" phone next time..I would have no hesitation buying another Alcatel phone when this one is ready to retire in another year or two. Or maybe three if it keeps working, since it certainly is meeting my phone, e-mail, snapshot and web surfing needs very well.","907","Alcatel","2"
"1674","ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)","129","3","Decent phone, shame it died one day after the one year warranty ended. It was while I was playing kingdom hearts unchained x. Symptoms were: phone got hot, touch screen became unresponsive on and off, the next day blue screen, rebooted, another blue screen, then phone completely died.Dual front facing speakers that get nice and loud so that's a huge plus, mine came with jbl earbuds which is awesome considering how most phones don't even include them anymore. But, the placement of the auxiliary port is located at the top of the phone and this is weird because the mini usb port is located on the bottom. If you used one of those magnetic air vent phone holders for you car, things will get messy as there's no clear orientation to have good cable management when you want to plug the auxiliary cable to your phone while charging. However, the reversible design is nice so that you can make the auxiliary cable be located on the bottom relatively by putting the phone upside down.Coming from a samsung galaxy s3, the idol 3's screen is much more vibrant. Also the phone is about 7mm thin which is just 1mm thicker than the thinnest phone out there. Also you should plan on getting a case for the phone, the back of this phone is really slippery with zero grip which is awful for such a thin phone. So if you get sweaty hands due to the heat emitted from this phone, the chance of it falling is quite high. Another plus was that alcatel did provide a software update to Android Marshmallow, which no one thought they would do considering the idol 4 was coming out, the idol 3 was made by a chinese company which don't really provide software support, and that the idol 3 was a budget phone. The stock os doesn't really come with a lot of bloat, although surprisingly, the clock app that comes with the phone is actually made by avg, the same guys that make the antivirus, which no one would have found out until one day play store decided to update the clock app. The updated clock app was terrible because it went away from the google's material design to some awkward interface. The average rating was around 2 stars before avg reverted back to the original clock app. The biggest con I would have to mention is the very slow flash storage, this is really noticeable when you load files or install apps in the play store.Oh well, time to get a new phone and this is just a lesson to always back up your texts and photos as well as get an extended warranty if you plan on using the phone for a very long time. Especially on devices like these where there is no removable back cover. I set the expected usage to a year anyways when I bought the phone considering it was only 250 when I bought it. The phone did get cheaper, but that's to be expected as time goes on.-----update 9/13/16---------Wow, so they still honored the warranty when my phone died. Fantastic service; they went above and beyond. They shipped the phone back with 2 day ups air too.","907","Alcatel","2"

I agree as the home button was not correct and was off center and the body of the phone had pulled away from the screen on one end. So far I have spent over 2 hours dealing with this phone.

Couple of details: the phone does not come with a charger only the cable, chargers are cheap at amazon, the other is that while this a Verizon phone I went to Cricket, they are owned by AT&T so they use their towers and got 2.5 GB of data and unlimited voice and text for 35 bucks with auto pay, AT&T is not Verizon but its good enough for me. They will insert their sim card and its ready to go.","441","Apple","3"
"1774","Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green","33","4","I bought this phone originally for myself and the phone itself it great but it didn't come with a new SIM card so I had to buy a kit. That was my only qualm with this phone. The color is cute and the size is perfect; I love the new chargers, I got this phone after having an iPhone 4 and the charger was always breaking on me so this was a nice change. As paranoid as I am about dropping iPhones ( since I had a iPhone 4) I did drop this a few times before I could get a case and was pleasantly surprised that the screen held up! One thing I dislike about Apple products is the headphones, they are way too big for my ears and don't have good connectivity so I never use them and I feel as if they're going to waste! I did pass this phone onto my mother for an upgrade but I was also surprised when my mother ( a 50 year old non- tech savvy woman) came to me and told me she loved it as well! She found some of the apps to be too much but after she got the hang of how everything worked she really enjoyed it. She very much loves to use the FaceTime option.","441","Apple","3"

"1793","Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green","33","2","This may seem really ridiculous but I ordered this last week and got it Saturday. Before I got it activated the other night the screen was messing up on me. I was having a lot of fun trying to put in my WiFi information. Anyway, I got it activated last night and everything was working fine. But now it's back to the way it was before it was activated. The screen was acting like it was possessed or a chipmunk on rd caffeine. It kept going to comments or my messages or previous pages on the Facebook app and it even did it on the Safari app when I decided to just use Facebook on that. Still acted up. I was really looking forward to trying out Apple but I'm really disappointed. Even with that 9.0.2 update or whatever it is, it's still doing it. The phone itself is great but that touchscreen thing, REALLY needs to be fixed. As well as on their future models. The only other positive thing I can say is that it finally showed my music than my previous phone did (not an iPhone). It would show less than half of it even though it was all right on the micro SD card I had in it.I will try Apple again someday when it gets better hopefully. If not, it's either just not meant for me, I got a lemon, or I should just curse the fact that I have big fingers. Lol.","441","Apple","3"

"1819","Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green","33","5","I purchased this phone after not reading thoroughly, from another vendor and ended up with an unlocked iPhone incompatible with my carrier/ provider. Although disappointing, it was totally my fault. Luckily, I was able to return that phone and purchase this one. It is very important to educate yourself and read all of the product description before purchasing something like this. Although The previous vendor I worked with was fantastic with the return and refund process, I could've save myself the hassle if I just paid attention. Moving on, this phone is fantastic. It is completely functional, and works better than a previous iPhone I had purchased brand-new. If you are buying this iPhone and have not previously owned an iPhone, you will need to purchase a Sim card to activate this phone. You can get them for a small charge at your local Carrier/Provider/Apple store, or you can just order one here and save yourself the hassle. Again make sure the Sim card is appropriate to your carrier/ provider.I see some top rated reviews here indicating not to trust the seller. I have to say that the seller was absolutely phenomenal, everything arrived in tiptop condition and in all original packaging, with Apple certified charger and earbuds. I really couldn't be happier with the purchase. Just remember, be specific about your carrier. Also remember, unlocked does not mean compatible with server. Any refurbished iPhone you purchase will be unlocked, but if you have a Verizon carrier get a Verizon compatible phone, same with AT&T, Sprint, or whatever the case may be. The same goes with the Sim card, make sure it is compatible with your carrier. I cannot emphasize this enough.","441","Apple","3"

I absolutely love the lightweight feel, and the ease of carry.However without a case this phone is very easily broken. I am a major clutz and have dropped my phone on the daily since I received it, but as it's been in the case during those drops it has sustained only one major screen shatter- when it dropped out of my pocket from two stories above ground.If you are familiar with apple, and want a reliable phone that is an older model, this is the way to go. Also according to my seventeen year old brother, it is a great starting phone.I'd Highly recommend.","441","Apple","3"

When I say this phone that I'm doing this review on, is soooooo amazing!!! It's get 5 starts in all areas I can think about! The phone came in a timetable manner and the seller was VERY nice, she was amazing with giving me information on where my package was and etc.! Not only that but the phone came very clean and absolutely NO cracks or even scratches. It looked brand new and the speed on the phone is outstanding, battery life lasts all day I would find myself charging my phone only twice a day if I was on it from morning to before I went to bed. Now the phone came with JUST the phone no charger or headphones but that was no problem for me. I brought a charger the same day and I already had a pair of headphones from a friend with an IPhone! But overall if your having second thought you shouldn't because this was the best order I've had in years!! Thanks and much love 💕😊","441","Apple","3"

"1856","Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green","33","1","Update: I am not blaming the vendor, but I did purchase an internally damaged phone from Cellular Trendz.Over a year ago I bought a white iPhone 5c on here from ""WeSellCellular"" and the phone was great and at a great price. I needed another cheap 5c so I got a green one from Cellular Trendz. Everything was fine except the battery life lasted a few hours even without me touching the phone. I am tech savvy and I've done numerous iPhone repairs myself so I bought a reputable battery here on Amazon. I opened the phone and I noticed one of the water damage indicators was red. Red= water damaged, white = never been exposed to water. I checked the other internal water damage indicator and it was also red. One of the screws that holds the battery connector in place was missing, but, it gets worse. There are RICE GRAINS inside the phone!! Not one or two random unidentifiable crumbs but multiple rice grains lodged in crevices of the phone. This leads me to believe someone water damaged the phone, removed the battery, and stuck it in rice.Good for a backup phone or someone who really wants an iPhone while on a budget. However, with the latest iOS 9 update this phone is slower than ever! Try and get one with iOS 8.4 or prior, but for long-term use I would go for a newer model.","441","Apple","3"

"1874","Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green","33","5","Purchased from Bobcat Wireless and received a great Refurbished phone. Came in generic packaging, but had an Apple charger. Setup was tricky at Verizon but the dude got it done. This phone is basically an iphone 5 in Color...which is what the C stands for. It does not have Fingerprint Sensor or some of the added camera specs of the 5s, but for normal, daytime pix, this phone is great. The exterior is a tough plastic exterior around aluminum. The size is nice. If you are like me and can't stand the thought of holding a tablet to your ear, you will like the size and feel of this phone. The color is great. I bought this for my son, but honestly, I had a hard time handing it over. The green phone is a tad lighter than standard Minecraft green. Fellow geeks will understand. I went with 32GB. I don't recommend going with anything less unless you have the restraint to use only a handful of apps. I wish this phone had offered the 64GB option. This phone is fast. It moves seamlessly from songs to apps, etc. Apparently you have to set Siri up on this phone. I'll deal with that another day. But, very satisfied with this seller and phone. The phone did work with Verizon, although unlocked. And, the iCloud and iTunes information from the previous owner was completely deleted.","441","Apple","3"

To make a long, very negative story short and sweet, I ended up buying a VERIZON iPhone just like this one (blue, too) and IMMEDIATELY took my service back to Verizon; they only charge me $45 a month without a contract anyway. BUT... when my bill came from AT&T (only 3 weeks into my new service), they wanted almost $67 from me after telling me it would only be $45 from the beginning!!!! - HA - I'm not stupid and I refuse to be lied to, so that's why I changed back to Verizon with the same type of phone - because both Verizon and the PHONE rock!","441","Apple","3"

I chose to purchase the green one, which was a fun spring green! It took two weeks to arrive at my doorstep, but the product booted just fine and worked for about a month. The processing is much faster than the iPhone 4, but in comparison to my mom's iPhone 6, it might just be worth waiting for the next iPhone to come out in the next couple of months. The ear piece stopped working after 32 days. I returned to the seller for a refund, but they charged me a 50% restocking fee.

I'm probably going to trade this in for a Samsung. This was my first Apple purchase and I am very disappointed.

Hardware was fine and functional, no significant scratches on phone (I think better than the 8/10 they advertised, but that's all subjective), and device had a clean IMEI and MEID from a couple different sources. Using it on ATT w/o difficulty.Hope this doesn't drive the price up, as I might buy another(!), but in the interest of honesty, I'm pleased.","441","Apple","3"

This was perfect for that purpose.This phone arrived today, and so far I have had no issues getting it set up and moving my stuff over. The phone came packaged with headphones, a charger cord & adapter, all of which seem to work fine.This phone does NOT come with an SIM card. I was able to quickly move the card from my old phone over. If you don't currently have a phone with a SIM card, you need to purchase that as well.","441","Apple","3"

So sensitive, it goes into Mute, Speaker or FaceTime when I am on all calls. When business Conference calls mute me as I am communicating, disconnects as I am receiving important information, I am losing valuable time (read money) getting back on track of a conversation with my refurbished iPhone. *Sigh Then 3 weeks after that, my cell phone does not ring for calls nor dings for msgs.

I gave it three stars because of everything else.It comes with headphones, a wall charger and cable, but they were all different brands. The wall charger was some off brand, the cable was belkin but what was weird is that the headphones were really nice, dreys beats, the kind that go IN your ear, but they were used (gross).","441","Apple","3"

The rep at the Verizon store could not register the phone on the Verizon system. After closer inspection, he felt that it was a knock-off. I agree as the home button was not correct and was off center and the body of the phone had pulled away from the screen on one end. So far I have spent over 2 hours dealing with this phone. I did process a return for a refund and will purchase another 5C from a different supplier.","441","Apple","3"

Couple of details: the phone does not come with a charger only the cable, chargers are cheap at amazon, the other is that while this a Verizon phone I went to Cricket, they are owned by AT&T so they use their towers and got 2.5 GB of data and unlimited voice and text for 35 bucks with auto pay, AT&T is not Verizon but its good enough for me. They will insert their sim card and its ready to go.","441","Apple","3"
"2003","Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green","33","4","I bought this phone originally for myself and the phone itself it great but it didn't come with a new SIM card so I had to buy a kit. That was my only qualm with this phone. The color is cute and the size is perfect; I love the new chargers, I got this phone after having an iPhone 4 and the charger was always breaking on me so this was a nice change. As paranoid as I am about dropping iPhones ( since I had a iPhone 4) I did drop this a few times before I could get a case and was pleasantly surprised that the screen held up! One thing I dislike about Apple products is the headphones, they are way too big for my ears and don't have good connectivity so I never use them and I feel as if they're going to waste! I did pass this phone onto my mother for an upgrade but I was also surprised when my mother ( a 50 year old non- tech savvy woman) came to me and told me she loved it as well! She found some of the apps to be too much but after she got the hang of how everything worked she really enjoyed it. She very much loves to use the FaceTime option.","441","Apple","3"

"2007","Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green","33","3","The case was more beat up than expected. We had to remove the screen and unplug and re-plug the 3 screen connections several times to get it to respond consistently, but other than that it's an iPhone and seems to work; now the screen is failing more often and it is past the 30 day warranty, we will likely need to replace it or the phone.

""A few wear and tear scratches, but looks very good."" They were right, the back had a few scratches, but nothing that my Otterbox would not cover over anyways! :) The screen was perfect, not one scratch on it! I am NOT a technology person, and I didn't understand the ""No SIM card"" thing. I had no clue that it was a needed thing for my phone. However, I took my phone to Verizon to get it activated and they just gave me one, no problem, no charge. It was simple.THANK YOU VERY MUCH, for the great service and the phone.

When I tried for warranty replacement, I found out that this was not actually a blue iPhone; the original seller had taken a pink iPhone and put a blue cover on it.

"2100","Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green","33","5","This is the version of the iphone you want if you are an international traveler from the states. Either the iPhone 5, 5c, or 5S; if you don't get the factory unlocked version online, then buy the Verizon Wireless version only. Unlike AT&T and Sprint (DO NOT buy the Sprint model, they don't support enough LTE bands for international travel) Verizon sells their phones unlocked. With AT&T you have to go through a lot of red tape just to get it unlocked; not cool. If you decided to buy directly from a Verzion store, just buy the phone without a contract and go with a month-to-month plan. People think they are getting a deal on the phone by getting the 2-year contract, but in the long run, you will be spending WAAAYYY more than if you would just spend the money for the phone out right and go with a prepaid plan. You'll save a lot more money that way. Spend $500 now and have the freedom to go with any phone company you want, or spend about $2000 for the next two years?

"2125","Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - White","139.95","2","This may seem really ridiculous but I ordered this last week and got it Saturday. Before I got it activated the other night the screen was messing up on me. I was having a lot of fun trying to put in my WiFi information. Anyway, I got it activated last night and everything was working fine. But now it's back to the way it was before it was activated. The screen was acting like it was possessed or a chipmunk on rd caffeine. It kept going to comments or my messages or previous pages on the Facebook app and it even did it on the Safari app when I decided to just use Facebook on that. Still acted up. I was really looking forward to trying out Apple but I'm really disappointed. Even with that 9.0.2 update or whatever it is, it's still doing it. The phone itself is great but that touchscreen thing, REALLY needs to be fixed. As well as on their future models. The only other positive thing I can say is that it finally showed my music than my previous phone did (not an iPhone). It would show less than half of it even though it was all right on the micro SD card I had in it.I will try Apple again someday when it gets better hopefully.

I'm probably going to trade this in for a Samsung. This was my first Apple purchase and I am very disappointed.

"2211","Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - White","139.95","5","I purchased this phone after not reading thoroughly, from another vendor and ended up with an unlocked iPhone incompatible with my carrier/ provider. Although disappointing, it was totally my fault. Luckily, I was able to return that phone and purchase this one. It is very important to educate yourself and read all of the product description before purchasing something like this. Although The previous vendor I worked with was fantastic with the return and refund process, I could've save myself the hassle if I just paid attention. Moving on, this phone is fantastic. It is completely functional, and works better than a previous iPhone I had purchased brand-new. If you are buying this iPhone and have not previously owned an iPhone, you will need to purchase a Sim card to activate this phone. You can get them for a small charge at your local Carrier/Provider/Apple store, or you can just order one here and save yourself the hassle. Again make sure the Sim card is appropriate to your carrier/ provider.I see some top rated reviews here indicating not to trust the seller. I have to say that the seller was absolutely phenomenal, everything arrived in tiptop condition and in all original packaging, with Apple certified charger and earbuds. I really couldn't be happier with the purchase. Just remember, be specific about your carrier. Also remember, unlocked does not mean compatible with server. Any refurbished iPhone you purchase will be unlocked, but if you have a Verizon carrier get a Verizon compatible phone, same with AT&T, Sprint, or whatever the case may be. The same goes with the Sim card, make sure it is compatible with your carrier. I cannot emphasize this enough.","310","Apple","3"

The condition is much better than I imagined! Personally, I would list this phone as Excellent or mint. It's perfect except for one tiny scratch near the power button.The screen is in PERFECT condition with no scratches. I put a TechArmor glass screen protector on it and also an Otterbox Commuter.It came with a charger and sync cable which work as they should.The phone came with iOS 8.1.1 which was perfect for jailbreaking.Clean IMEI, no iCloud lock.","310","Apple","3"

"2256","Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - White","139.95","5","Purchased from Bobcat Wireless and received a great Refurbished phone. Came in generic packaging, but had an Apple charger. Setup was tricky at Verizon but the dude got it done. This phone is basically an iphone 5 in Color...which is what the C stands for. It does not have Fingerprint Sensor or some of the added camera specs of the 5s, but for normal, daytime pix, this phone is great. The exterior is a tough plastic exterior around aluminum. The size is nice. If you are like me and can't stand the thought of holding a tablet to your ear, you will like the size and feel of this phone. The color is great. I bought this for my son, but honestly, I had a hard time handing it over. The green phone is a tad lighter than standard Minecraft green. Fellow geeks will understand. I went with 32GB. I don't recommend going with anything less unless you have the restraint to use only a handful of apps. I wish this phone had offered the 64GB option. This phone is fast. It moves seamlessly from songs to apps, etc. Apparently you have to set Siri up on this phone. I'll deal with that another day. But, very satisfied with this seller and phone. The phone did work with Verizon, although unlocked. And, the iCloud and iTunes information from the previous owner was completely deleted.","310","Apple","3"

SHAME ON AMAZON TOO because they advertised 90 day A to Z guarantee on this product which of course led me to believe they would guarantee a good resolution for problems of defective merchandise but that was not the case!

"2298","Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - White","139.95","1","Update: I am not blaming the vendor, but I did purchase an internally damaged phone from Cellular Trendz.Over a year ago I bought a white iPhone 5c on here from ""WeSellCellular"" and the phone was great and at a great price. I needed another cheap 5c so I got a green one from Cellular Trendz. Everything was fine except the battery life lasted a few hours even without me touching the phone. I am tech savvy and I've done numerous iPhone repairs myself so I bought a reputable battery here on Amazon. I opened the phone and I noticed one of the water damage indicators was red. Red= water damaged, white = never been exposed to water. I checked the other internal water damage indicator and it was also red. One of the screws that holds the battery connector in place was missing, but, it gets worse. There are RICE GRAINS inside the phone!! Not one or two random unidentifiable crumbs but multiple rice grains lodged in crevices of the phone. This leads me to believe someone water damaged the phone, removed the battery, and stuck it in rice.Good for a backup phone or someone who really wants an iPhone while on a budget. However, with the latest iOS 9 update this phone is slower than ever! Try and get one with iOS 8.4 or prior, but for long-term use I would go for a newer model.","310","Apple","3"

Couple of details: the phone does not come with a charger only the cable, chargers are cheap at amazon, the other is that while this a Verizon phone I went to Cricket, they are owned by AT&T so they use their towers and got 2.5 GB of data and unlimited voice and text for 35 bucks with auto pay, AT&T is not Verizon but its good enough for me.

"2304","Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - White","139.95","4","I bought this phone originally for myself and the phone itself it great but it didn't come with a new SIM card so I had to buy a kit. That was my only qualm with this phone. The color is cute and the size is perfect; I love the new chargers, I got this phone after having an iPhone 4 and the charger was always breaking on me so this was a nice change. As paranoid as I am about dropping iPhones ( since I had a iPhone 4) I did drop this a few times before I could get a case and was pleasantly surprised that the screen held up! One thing I dislike about Apple products is the headphones, they are way too big for my ears and don't have good connectivity so I never use them and I feel as if they're going to waste! I did pass this phone onto my mother for an upgrade but I was also surprised when my mother ( a 50 year old non- tech savvy woman) came to me and told me she loved it as well! She found some of the apps to be too much but after she got the hang of how everything worked she really enjoyed it. She very much loves to use the FaceTime option.","310","Apple","3"

"2400","Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - White","139.95","5","I purchased this phone after not reading thoroughly, from another vendor and ended up with an unlocked iPhone incompatible with my carrier/ provider. Although disappointing, it was totally my fault. Luckily, I was able to return that phone and purchase this one. It is very important to educate yourself and read all of the product description before purchasing something like this. Although The previous vendor I worked with was fantastic with the return and refund process, I could've save myself the hassle if I just paid attention. Moving on, this phone is fantastic. It is completely functional, and works better than a previous iPhone I had purchased brand-new. If you are buying this iPhone and have not previously owned an iPhone, you will need to purchase a Sim card to activate this phone. You can get them for a small charge at your local Carrier/Provider/Apple store, or you can just order one here and save yourself the hassle. Again make sure the Sim card is appropriate to your carrier/ provider.I see some top rated reviews here indicating not to trust the seller. I have to say that the seller was absolutely phenomenal, everything arrived in tiptop condition and in all original packaging, with Apple certified charger and earbuds. I really couldn't be happier with the purchase. Just remember, be specific about your carrier. Also remember, unlocked does not mean compatible with server. Any refurbished iPhone you purchase will be unlocked, but if you have a Verizon carrier get a Verizon compatible phone, same with AT&T, Sprint, or whatever the case may be. The same goes with the Sim card, make sure it is compatible with your carrier. I cannot emphasize this enough.","310","Apple","3"

To make a long, very negative story short and sweet, I ended up buying a VERIZON iPhone just like this one (blue, too) and IMMEDIATELY took my service back to Verizon; they only charge me $45 a month without a contract anyway. BUT... when my bill came from AT&T (only 3 weeks into my new service), they wanted almost $67 from me after telling me it would only be $45 from the beginning!!!! - HA - I'm not stupid and I refuse to be lied to, so that's why I changed back to Verizon with the same type of phone - because both Verizon and the PHONE rock!","310","Apple","3"

"2420","Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - White","139.95","2","The standing joke about the Apple iPhone 5c is that the ""c"" stands for ""cheap,"" not ""color."" The phone came with a sim card that you'll have to take to the Verizon store to activate. It also comes with a SIM port key, earbuds, a charger and the fun standard Apple icon stickers. I chose to purchase the green one, which was a fun spring green! It took two weeks to arrive at my doorstep, but the product booted just fine and worked for about a month. The processing is much faster than the iPhone 4, but in comparison to my mom's iPhone 6, it might just be worth waiting for the next iPhone to come out in the next couple of months. The ear piece stopped working after 32 days. I returned to the seller for a refund, but they charged me a 50% restocking fee. When it worked, the phone was nice and fun because of the color, but working with this vendor isn't worth it.","310","Apple","3"

When I received the replacement clearly it was the same phone as I had forgotten to remove the screen protector. What's worse. The battery life now was less than 1hoir usage straight out of the box after full 7hr recharge from the wall adapter and no added apps.So I decided rather than waste any more money shipping back to this incompetent repair center I'd just buy the battery replace kit and do it myself!wish I'd spent the little extra to get at the Apple Store now.","255","Apple","3"

There were a few scuffs on the top but no scratches or cracks that weren't previously mentioned from the seller. Finally, all I did was put my sim card in (T-Mobile​) and the phone was working right away. I didn't have to call my phone company and this phone set up in any way.

"2622","Apple A1533 Unlocked iPhone 5S Smart Phone, 16 GB (White)","115","4","The phone came in a sealed apple box and really does look like new. The only thing which was odd, was that when I checked for Apple warranty online they told me that the warranty was expired and the phone was produced more than 2 years ago. Customer service guaranteed me that still the phone was new and not refurbished and I was sticking with that, as really everything else seemed like new.Another small thing which is odd: this phone has Chinese preinstalled as language in all apps and many sub menus. Although changing the primary language to English it was not possible to remove Chinese completely as a language. I tried to get around that by installing Spanish as a second language so Chinese is now only third. Nevertheless Chinese signs keep popping up from time to time on the phone.","255","Apple","3"

It actually didn't have any scratches or noticeable damage or scratches anywhere! I knew the charger wouldn't be the orginal but the charger i got didn't last long. the charger started to mess up and i have to play with it to get it to charge until i can get a new charger :( the charger is the only reason i don't give 5 stars.","255","Apple","3"
"2654","Apple A1533 Unlocked iPhone 5S Smart Phone, 16 GB (White)","115","1","Don't waste your time .buy from the Apple Store.When I got mine the battery life was very poor 2 hours usage 6 hours standby with no added apps and all the standard settings for battery life. After researching the problem and tryin everything it was clearly a bad battery.I paid to return it and the seller emailed me to say a replacement was sent. When I received the replacement clearly it was the same phone as I had forgotten to remove the screen protector. What's worse. The battery life now was less than 1hoir usage straight out of the box after full 7hr recharge from the wall adapter and no added apps.So I decided rather than waste any more money shipping back to this incompetent repair center I'd just buy the battery replace kit and do it myself!wish I'd spent the little extra to get at the Apple Store now.","255","Apple","3"

He managed to change the SIM, but couldn't do anything about the phone's defect, advising me to go to Apple. I went to Apple, and they said that they couldn't replace the defective phone because all the parts weren't Apple. The back was fake, and too small for the phone to sit flush in. I had to return it, and three days after it reached them, I filed a complaint because they didn't refund my money. Amazon was able to get my refund, thankfully. I would advise anyone looking for an iphone to use another vendor.","246","Apple","3"

"2760","Apple a1549 iPhone 6 64GB T-Mobile (silver)","309.99","4","I bought the iPhone 6 Gold 64GB from Wireless Warehouse. It was said to be in excellent condition I picked it up for about $400. I get the phone, overall it was in good condition. It had one little ding on the bottom right nothing too noticeable. After using it for about 2 days I noticed the battery life was absolutely dreadful. Luckily, the firmware was on 9.3.3 so it could be jailbroken. I jailbroke the iPhone I downloaded a tweak to give me information about my battery life it's at ~40-60% capacity it likes to jump around, it had over 800 charges. The iPhone was used a lot I could tell. So I am going to order an external battery and take apart the phone. Now if anyone else has a bad battery and they need to switch it out I recommend you go with extreme caution. If you're not comfortable with doing it then I highly recommend you don't do it. If you can pay apple their fee (which I think is roughly $100) then I would do that. However, I don't really feel apple should get $100 for a battery you can pick up for $20. But again I am fairly comfortable with taking apart my phone. Overall I am happy about the phone I will update later once I order the battery and get it put in.","246","Apple","3"

I tested the phone out before I gifted it to my girlfriend and it is steps above her old iPhone. Great replacement and worth the cost.As a note for those looking for a compatible T-Mobile iPhone 6, ensure that the box/label says ""A1649"" as the model. Regardless of the branding on the box, this will ensure you have full T-Mobile coverage.","246","Apple","3"

I get the phone, overall it was in good condition. It had one little ding on the bottom right nothing too noticeable. After using it for about 2 days I noticed the battery life was absolutely dreadful. Luckily, the firmware was on 9.3.3 so it could be jailbroken. I jailbroke the iPhone I downloaded a tweak to give me information about my battery life it's at ~40-60% capacity it likes to jump around, it had over 800 charges. The iPhone was used a lot I could tell. So I am going to order an external battery and take apart the phone. Now if anyone else has a bad battery and they need to switch it out I recommend you go with extreme caution. If you're not comfortable with doing it then I highly recommend you don't do it. If you can pay apple their fee (which I think is roughly $100) then I would do that. However, I don't really feel apple should get $100 for a battery you can pick up for $20. But again I am fairly comfortable with taking apart my phone. Overall I am happy about the phone I will update later once I order the battery and get it put in.","246","Apple","3"

I took it to the phone carrier who pointed out that the phone was sticking out and not flush with the casing. He managed to change the SIM, but couldn't do anything about the phone's defect, advising me to go to Apple. I went to Apple, and they said that they couldn't replace the defective phone because all the parts weren't Apple. The back was fake, and too small for the phone to sit flush in. I had to return it, and three days after it reached them, I filed a complaint because they didn't refund my money. Amazon was able to get my refund, thankfully. I would advise anyone looking for an iphone to use another vendor.","246","Apple","3"

I had attempted to set up an account with ""T-Mobile"" but they kept on asking for information about me that I already had provided, I grew frustrated and canceled my order.It was at this point that I decided to purchase this phone. I would have been better off if I had provided ""T-Mobile"" with the same information for the next 1,000,000 years! When I opened the package I discovered that the bottom portion of the phone which functions as a sort of case for the battery compartment was damaged, the phone doesn't or can't scroll up or down, and the printing in the instructional manual is so microscopic that you need Superman's eyesight just to have a chance to read it, furthermore unlike some other technology related products there is no online version of the manual that you can turn to so that you can read it easier.The battery is lousy, it provides ""power"" for only about 5 minutes, a major problem also is that after you open the package you discover that you were given the wrong information as to what memory card to purchase the information that is given by the provider to ""Amazon"" is that it takes a micro SD card, it does not, instead it requires a SIM card.It goes without saying that it would have been most helpful if I had known this in advance as I would never have ordered a piece of crap such as this.I believe that a refund is in order and that is being quite mild about it.","378","BlackBerry","4"

"2980","BlackBerry Bold 9000 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS Navigation, and MicroSD Slot--International Version with No Warranty (Black)","99.98","5","Hi!I have bough this phone as a birthday gift for my teenager daughter. She has been using it for about three weeks, now. The phone came nicely packed. It was unlocked as advertised, and came with cables, charger and a screen-shield sheet. I could see no scratches on the cover, which fit just fine onto the back of the phone. The phone works pretty fine with Vivo, Oi and Claro carriers in Brazil. Therefore, I induce that it shall work as fine with other GSM carriers around the World. Regarding additional functionalities, wifi works great. Rear camera is only 2 MP but is still good enough to take some pictures (Not a 'Brastemp' camera, though, as they used to say in Brazil. [Note: In Brazil, a 'Brastemp' product or functionality of a product is a regional expression indicating either a product or a functionality of a product that does its job nicely and smooth, and even exceeds expectations). There is no front camera. Web browser is awesome and trackball superb. It comes with several pre-installed applications, and yet one can download another bunch of them. The keyboard is Ok, but as you know, one still needs to get used of it, as keys are small and tightly close each other, and one may miss a key or two while typing faster. Anyway, keypad in resistant. Neither my daughter nor I myself have tried either GPS or bluetooth, so far. You can also add a micro Sd card, which could make a difference if large storage amount is needed.Well, overall, a very good device and it have exactly met my daughter's expectations. So I give it five stars.Peace and blessings.","378","BlackBerry","4"

It was delivered very quickly, with all correct packaging.However there is a problem with the phone: +86 is automatically inserted before stored numbers- if i save a number either with or without a country code, it will still add 86 before the saved number. 86 is the country code for China. The handset says AT&T. The only way to make a call is to manually type in the number (so you can't click on stored contacts, click on numbers in emails, etc).I've just read other reviews from OEM Shop BB Bold ""new"" purchases with AT&T logo with similar problems (the phones appear to either be used/refurbished or cheaply manufactured to a standard to lower than other BB).----I also wanted to clarify this phone was purchased with a full warranty for 1 year however OEM will not honor this. I have gotten two responses from OEM customer service: the first asked me for the IMEI number from the back of the phone. I sent all the numbers on the back of the phone; they didn't recognize any of them and then asked instead for the Amazon order number. After I emailed the order number I never heard back, despite follow up emails.I recommend not purchasing an unlocked BB through Amazon and avoid purchases from OEM. I've read about numerous unlocked BB problems and thought that buying from OEM which had good reviews and offered a warranty, would minimize the chance of being ripped off. I was wrong! I spent $345 on a defective or refurbished phone that doesn't dial correctly.","378","BlackBerry","4"

I guess I thought, ""Even if it is a refurbished phone, who cares? As long as it works."" So I bought it, and at first I was quite pleased. The battery drained quickly, but other than that, everything was fine. That was before I tried to get a data plan (when I was just using the phone for talking and texting). I've spent six hours at the T-mobile store over the past two weeks trying to trouble-shoot this thing, and the techies there say they've never seen anything like it. The phone cannot access the data plan I have. At first we thought it was due to corrupted software, so we replaced it. But even with the software overhaul, the phone doesn't allow you to switch from ""Hotspot Browser"" (wifi) to ""Internet Browser"" (to be used with any carrier's data plan). It's really strange. But it defeats the point of having a SmartPhone if you can only access the internet and email when you can get wifi. Thank God I bought a warranty to go with it. I'll definitely be sending this thing back. It's not worth the headaches, time, money, and inconvenience. Don't buy!","378","BlackBerry","4"

"3053","BlackBerry Bold 9000 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS Navigation, and MicroSD Slot--International Version with No Warranty (Black)","99.98","1","This was purchased as a specific request for a relative. She needed a Blackberry under a certain amount of money and the Bold 9000 was the only thing other than the older Curve and Tour models available.It's difficult to leave a practical review for a phone released in 2008. It feels its age, really dated. We've come strides and I own a Nexus 4. That being said, I will try to be as objective as possible.Personally, I truly believe that she would have been wholly better off with a cheap Android or Windows phone vs. this device. It is pretty much stuck as it is. There is no update possible. 4.6 is the last OS version unless ""modding"" is involved (by that I mean there's no official update). The phone has ~45MB of free space, but at least there's an SD Card.It works well and it is ""quick"", so to speak. I haven't really seen any lagging so far and calls are crisp and clear. It has a 2MP camera and is 3G capable. It is a quad band phone so it works with most GSM carriers.This is focussed at the seller.One thing that I didn't like is that the phone is advertised by BLUTEKUSA as new but is reconditioned. I've owned cell phones for 15+ years and by now can definitely tell between a brand new unboxing vs. opening up something that is refurbished. Also, and this is the kicker - I've opened up brand new bold 9000s before, as well as other BB devices. There's even a scuff mark on the battery and side of the phone. It didn't come with a manual or those booklets you always throw out because they're useless anyway, earphones, usb cable, etc. I got the phone, battery and charger cable - that's it. I'm considering returning it because I could just buy a phone advertised as refurbished for 1/2 the price from other vendors on Amazon. It's pretty dishonest. Amazon needs to change their policies in terms of how vendors advertise items as new vs. refurbished.Update: BLUTEKUSA contacted me asking me to remove my 3 star feedback (not this review) that I gave them to which I politely declined. It wasn't even negative, per se. I just put the facts. As I said in my response to them, sometimes you only get one chance to make a customer happy. This is one of those cases, there is no opportunity for a do-over. I was to send the phone to a relative abroad through a visiting family member. I had no chance to even source an alternative or replacement elsewhere much less from Blutekusa, so I have to stand by my feedback and I will now remove 1 star from my review here because the last thing you should do as a store is ask a customer to remove negative feedback.","378","BlackBerry","4"

I paid for 2 day shipping and received the phone on time. it had everything a new phone should and even came with a free blackberry Bluetooth headphone. The phone came in AT&T box which was what the person who helped us to unlock it exactly wanted (he recommended buying AT&T or t-mobile phone because they are more compatible with international phones). So anyway, the phone arrived in excellent condition (although it seems like this was a factory refurbished phone, but it still looked like new). I saw a little scratch on the screen when I unwrapped it, but it turns out the scratch was only on the plastic cover and didn't affect the phone. The only negative was that the back cover (where you put the battry and the sim card) was a little shaky, so I bought one of those protective covers which not only made it more study but also made the phone look more beautiful like new.","378","BlackBerry","4"

I've contacted amazon about it, hopefully they can fix the listing/hardware issues.The handsets (I've gone through two - an exchange to see if I'd get anything different) are O2 UK branded. They are indeed unlocked, but they're not the unbranded international version that was expected. They have O2 branding on the body and an O2-branded UI (boot splash, browser, etc.)The phone works fine, gets great reception, and the Bold 9000 itself is the last in a line of excellent phones from RIM, definitely worth the purchase if you know what to expect.The box contains a card from a now-defunct cellular company ""PDA Giant"" - they appear to be some halfway fishy operation out of Florida, probably why they're now-defunct.The phone was dusty, I didn't find any odd pictures on it like other buyers have said, but given the originating source of these, I'm really not surprised this happened. It looks like these have been in a warehouse for a while thoughMy box contained:* BlackBerry Bold 9000 handset, O2 UK branded and a battery door* a COUNTERFEIT battery. These are generally DANGEROUS and are the most frequent type of battery to explode on users. I'd recommend not using the battery, I purchased a BlackBerry M-S1 battery from Amazon [...] that appears to be legit, it has all the standard RIM markings on it. The counterfeit battery doesn't hold as much of a charge as the OEM battery either. I wouldn't get a day's use out of the phone with the counterfeit battery, on the OEM battery I get over 2 days.* What appears to be an OEM wall charger* RIM support CD* None of the usual product documentation or manuals* No headset or other accessoriesKnowing all this, it really is a pretty competitive price for this handset, better than most of the other cell vendors online, even with the added cost of buying a legitimate battery.I'd recommend the handset for purchase, but use caution, and be prepared to exchange it a few times. I give 3 stars for the inaccurate listing, package conditions and a dangerous counterfeit battery.Update: I purchased a third figuring I knew what to expect. The third one:* Came in a different box from the last 2* Came with a charger that was already opened* Came with a leather pouch the other two didn't come with* Had a Motorola-branded USB cable with it* Was an unbranded BlackBerry but appeared to have a T-mobile phone numbers sticker on the screen* Still came with a used counterfeit battery* Had goop on the inside and the display looks like it's been serviced (improperly)* Was running an AT&T-branded OS (which means the AT&T logo bezel was probably removed and replaced during service)* TrackBall doesn't work* There was a picture on it of the cell phone warehouse where these phones were modified.

The battery was literally stock to the ph (i had use tools to remove it) they promised earphones that never arrived. All my ideas and thoughts about buying phones at amazon just vanished. The latest issue happened a week ago when suddenly the device turned off, its red light from the top started blinking and it never turn on again, now i have a useless device that works for nothing. If you are reading this please think twice, well, more than twice or even better, don't even think on buying this type of phones over amazon. I used to think that people who wroted feedbacks on this section were angry people who just wanted to create a bad reputation on amazon but now, after taking the time, i see that i'm not the only customer with this issue.

If you buy this phone used, you will see a fake or generic type of battery that was probably used to replace the older battery and sometimes these phones are probably from people trading in their phones for the new blackberries.You have to take into consideration before you buy any international phone that isn't an Apple or Android Product that you will get a generic battery for replacement if you buy this phone refurbished or used. I do agree with buyers who got screwed with the brand new phones. I bought this phone brand new from a 3rd party seller that had the phone sealed and it came sealed with all authentic parts. So I suggest you think about buying from a third party. I do not buy refurbished phones from Amazon because most the time they will have a generic battery on the phone, a returned phone from a customer who ordered through their wireless services which gives you the chance you will get an AT&T Phone but these phones are unlocked and supposed to be.I suggest you buy from 3rd party sellers that has established positive feedback (I buy from companies that has feedback rating of over 98% and is fulfilled by Amazon). I ordered this phone from Amazon warehouse deals and overall it was well worth the purchase for what I paid for. It cost me 80 bucks for this typical phone which is still popular. The 9930 version is the most popular and still running around 260-280 bucks.This phone is probably one of the best phones that has the best rolling ball in the middle and have good navigation.","378","BlackBerry","4"

I purchased a blackberry bold from this company that was faulty and DOES NOT WORK and even before they saw the phone I purchased after I lodged my complaint (which they wanted me to apparently ship back at my own expense AFTER the purchase of a faulty phone) denied that that phone was in fact there own merchandise simply because I used a sky box!! This of course was after they firstly admitted that they have ""young staff that make mistakes"" and this was also after I have specifically stated that I have had my skybox company for YEARS and never had any experience with them tampering with any of my goods.Of course Cellphone Zone found it was reasonable for me to believe that my skybox company would open the box the phone came in, take out the blackberry I bought from Cellphone Zone and replace it with a faulty phone that was the exact model as the one I got for Cellphone Zone and then close back the box and somehow make it look like the seals were never broken or tampered with. To this company THAT apparently makes ""perfect"" sense instead of just admitting that they sold me a faulty product! Just letting buyers out there know what they are dealing with and that ALL is lost if you ever have to deal with this company for a claim and you used a skybox!!!!This company sells faulty phones!!!

When I found it on the website it said one year warranty if ordered from us. I guess I misunderstood that there wasn't a warranty if ordered through Amazon. The phone was new, and even though it was an older model than I realized, I was ok with it since I had in my possession older chargers and earpieces, but the phone won't charge properly. It keeps cycling and shutting off. I have learned a good lesson about ordering items like this on Amazon. In the future I will google the model and confirm warranty information. In researching the phone, there are numerous post about this problem.One of the solutions was to update the software from Blackberry, but the model is no longer supported bt Blackberry, so no updates available. I tried a few solutions, posted by techs online, but was unable to fix the problem. This is a business phone for me, I do a lot of texting and email, so limited charging, and shutting off won't work work for me.

This time, I thought Amazon would be a more trustworthy source it was quite disappointing. I got a phone in it's own box but firs thing that stroke me, a 1 year warranty card from Consumer Certified Repairs... this phone is supposed to be new!!! I got a refurbished phone!! Next disappointment, a cheap battery, not the original Blackberry battery. It holds a charge for about 8 hours. I had to but another one, which was another nightmare because Amazon sells many as ""the same that comes with Blackberry phones"" and the picture is of an original battery at $15. Now I don't trust Amazon so I did not purchase any of these but had to shell out another $50 for a Seidio. Another thing, I believe this phone should've included a protective ""leather"" case which comes with every BB and I did not get it. Now my last and greatest grievance and it goes in another paragraph...I was not able to get this phone on a Blackberry plan!! At the phone company they told me that the series this phone belongs to is not in the Blackberry database so it cannot be set up in the BB plan! I did not get any specifics, not sure what that means and not even sure if it is banned for any reason or what. Anyways, this is the last time I buy a cell phone from Amazon. The phone works very well so my review is not a total ""Sucks"", but it reflects my dissatisfaction with Amazon.","378","BlackBerry","4"

This item is not new and comes with parts not original to the phone. The box was not original. The phone did not work properly. The trackball would not scroll in certain directions, so the phone was basically useless. Thankfully, Amazon has a great return policy, if you purchase the phone directly from them. They refunded my full purchase price. I do not know who is actually selling these phones, but whoever it is, they are pulling a big scam. Do not order this phone.","378","BlackBerry","4"

Soon after, I noticed some of the icons just seemed to disappear, but still I did not complain. The Wi-Fi worked for the first month, but does not work now, keeps telling me I am not connected, even when I check the home Wi-Fi, works fine with other devices. I tried to install the CD that came with it, unfortunately that did not work because I have vista operating system, and the CD is not compatible with it. CD is dated 2004, maybe that's why. The GPS does nothing but say there's a GPS, but no way of executing it. The zoom button on the camera has now stopped functioning, mind you I've only had the phone for 2 months. I do not believe these are NEW phones, only returns and refurbished and sold as new. I paid the extra money to get those extra features, and sorry to say it was a waste, I did not end up with those extra features anyway. I am really disappointed in Amazon in regards to this cell phone. I have purchased previous items from them, and have had no problems. Maybe they should get out of the cell phone business. Best of luck if you decide to purchase after reading everyone's reviews.","378","BlackBerry","4"

Sometimes i wouldnt be able to send a text, sometimes the phone screen would simply turn white and oh yeah.. phone only vibrated with a low call sound. Definitely not what I paid for in terms of what there description advertised in terms of quality .. although i only paid 40 bucks.

I had attempted to set up an account with ""T-Mobile"" but they kept on asking for information about me that I already had provided, I grew frustrated and canceled my order.It was at this point that I decided to purchase this phone. I would have been better off if I had provided ""T-Mobile"" with the same information for the next 1,000,000 years! When I opened the package I discovered that the bottom portion of the phone which functions as a sort of case for the battery compartment was damaged, the phone doesn't or can't scroll up or down, and the printing in the instructional manual is so microscopic that you need Superman's eyesight just to have a chance to read it, furthermore unlike some other technology related products there is no online version of the manual that you can turn to so that you can read it easier.The battery is lousy, it provides ""power"" for only about 5 minutes, a major problem also is that after you open the package you discover that you were given the wrong information as to what memory card to purchase the information that is given by the provider to ""Amazon"" is that it takes a micro SD card, it does not, instead it requires a SIM card.It goes without saying that it would have been most helpful if I had known this in advance as I would never have ordered a piece of crap such as this.I believe that a refund is in order and that is being quite mild about it.","378","BlackBerry","4"

She has been using it for about three weeks, now. The phone came nicely packed. It was unlocked as advertised, and came with cables, charger and a screen-shield sheet. I could see no scratches on the cover, which fit just fine onto the back of the phone. The phone works pretty fine with Vivo, Oi and Claro carriers in Brazil. Therefore, I induce that it shall work as fine with other GSM carriers around the World. Regarding additional functionalities, wifi works great. Rear camera is only 2 MP but is still good enough to take some pictures (Not a 'Brastemp' camera, though, as they used to say in Brazil. [Note: In Brazil, a 'Brastemp' product or functionality of a product is a regional expression indicating either a product or a functionality of a product that does its job nicely and smooth, and even exceeds expectations). There is no front camera. Web browser is awesome and trackball superb. It comes with several pre-installed applications, and yet one can download another bunch of them. The keyboard is Ok, but as you know, one still needs to get used of it, as keys are small and tightly close each other, and one may miss a key or two while typing faster. Anyway, keypad in resistant. Neither my daughter nor I myself have tried either GPS or bluetooth, so far. You can also add a micro Sd card, which could make a difference if large storage amount is needed.Well, overall, a very good device and it have exactly met my daughter's expectations. So I give it five stars.Peace and blessings.","378","BlackBerry","4"

It came with the 3G platform 1,4 and 8. So it will only work with Digitel Venezuela.All I have to say is that you have make sure the phone has the 3G band 1,2,5 and 6. and it will work with Movistar and Movilnet.

Strangely you have not addressed my questions, the most important being whether what was sold to me was a new product as advertised. Instead of addressing questions clearly raised, you have chosen to side track and not respond to questions asked. This kind off attitude will certainly reflect very badly on a trusted site such as amazon. As stated earlier this phone did not work properly from the begining.

They were simply thrown into some bags3.The battery that came with the phone was also unusuable, as it was split open.4.Even the label on the side of the box when compared to another blackberry box seemed as if it was simply scanned, edited and pasted on.Overall i'm EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in this purcahse which i thought was going to be a new unused untouched phone. A return for a refund is in the works, although the inconvenience with the FALSE advertising and crushed hopes of recieving a phone ready to use is most upsetting.I would have probably just used the phone because i needed i one had it not been for the unusable battery, but i refuse to buy one when one should have been provided with my ""new"" phoneSincerely,Thoroughly Disappointed","706","BlackBerry","4"

To my surprise, I switched it on to find a thread of love text messages from some guy back in Oct 2010 which obviously means it had been used. The phone does look brand new and currently works without any problems. It better stay that way considering how much $$$$ is splashed out for the device!!!!So after about one month, the key pad especially the BB button started malfunctioning. I tried to return the phone unfortunately, becos i moved to Africa shortly after the purchase, US customs made it difficult to return to seller. So i decided to cut my losses and buy a new key pad which i did. It worked better although for the BB button, it was still faulty. I then realized it was a problem not of the key pad, but in the underlying board.So i've had to live and struggle with the phone until yesterday when the screen went crazy. Now i cant see anything on the screen. I'm going to have to buy a new one.......Lesson learned. This time, i'll buy directly from Blackberry or a national carrier","706","BlackBerry","4"

"3664","BlackBerry Bold 9780 Unlocked Cell Phone with Full QWERTY Keyboard, 5 MP Camera, Wi-Fi, 3G, Music/Video Playback, Bluetooth v2.1, and GPS (Black)","106.85","4","I bought my AT&T 9700 when it first came out years ago, got it unlocked after two years. I tried Android & Windowsphone, but I kept going back to my 9700 because it fits my medium hands very nicely.My AT&T 9700 has 3G bands 1, 2, 5, & 6, and my 9780 has 3G bands 1, 4, & 8. I'm currently subscribed to T-Mobile. Where I live, the cell signal is 3 bars if I'm near the window. My 9780 works a little better. At a brother's house, the cell signal is a strong 5 bars. My AT&T 9700 shows 3G; my 9780 shows EDGE. On both phones, the web and Accuweather work fine, but BlackBerry World does not work on the EDGE (the 9780). Because my 9780 works better at home and I don't need BBRY World, I switched permanently to my 9780. My AT&T 9700 will function as backup. Both batteries are identical so I don't need a new battery to replace the very old 9700 battery.I will use this opportunity to tell BlackBerry, Amazon, and all salesmen: A smartphone is worthless if WiFi is required to become fully functional. In other words, a smartphone needs to be fully functional on the cell carrier's network.","706","BlackBerry","4"

Also it came with a memory card of 2GB, it did not gave me any problems.At first I was going to buy it to another seller, but then I wrote and asked them if the cellphone would work on any band for the 3G, and they told me they didn't guarantee it, so I decided to buy it directly from amazon.com and it was the best choice I could ever done!Unfortunally I got stoled like 4 moths after I bought it, so I'm missing it, right now it is more expensive than it was when I bought it, so I hope that the price will go lower this month so I can buy it again :)------Compre este telefono en abril de 2011 directamente a amazon.com. El telefono vino con todas las especificaciones, (audifonos, cargador, bateria, etc), vino sin ninguna marca en el, es decir que puede utilizarse en cualquier compañia telefonica para el 3G (lo cual es importante en Lanioamerica). Ademas vino con una tarjeta de memoria de 2GB (lo cual no especifica), el telefono nunca me dio ningun problema.AL principio iba a comprarlo a otro vendedor, pero luego les escribi y les pregunte si el telefono funcionaría en cualquier banda de 3G, y me respondieron diciendo que no me lo garantizaban, así que decidi comprarlo directamente a amazon.com por un review que lei aqui mismo y fue la mejor elección que pude haber hecho!Desafortunadamente me robaron 4 meses despues de haber comprado el telefono, asi que me hace falta.. En este momento esta mucho mas costoso que cuando lo compre, asi que espero que el precio vaya a bajar para poder comprarlo de nuevo :)","706","BlackBerry","4"

For my part, I am satisfied with the cell phone, came in buenisima condicones and all its accessories, do not complain of the cell phone even though you buy it with caution, in the sense that they did not know if the 3G would work with the telephone line Digitel (Venezuela) because only indicated that working on the 3G network (1700, 2100 MHz). I think that should give more information as to the 3G network running cell phones, for example, in the case of BlackBerry, the box has a label indicating these specifications, eg 3G bands 1, 4, 8 . This means that: A = 2100 MHz 2 = 1900 MHz 4 = 1700 MHz 5 / 6 = 850 / 800 MHz 8 = 900 MHz","706","BlackBerry","4"

I had to buy a new battery and the phone lit normally.The other flaw was the trackpad, came damaged too, had to buy a new one and now the phone is fully operational. But the idea is to come 100% good and it was so. I hope this is not a failure in the future.Finally no 3G operator lifts where I have it (Movistar Venezuela), but it should be a problem of the operator, but the team should raise anyone 3G with this type of technology.El producto llego con 2 fallas.El producto llego en el tiempo correcto y desbloqueado, pero la bateria estaba dañada, al ponerla a cargar aparecia una X roja sobre el simbolo bateria, la lleve a un servicio tecnico y estaba muerta. Tuve que comprar una bateria nueva y el telefono encendio de manera normal.La otra falla fue el trackpad, vino dañado tambien, tuve que comprar uno nuevo y ya el telefono esta completamente operativo. Pero la idea es que viniera 100% bien y no fue asi. Espero que no presente alguna falla en el futuro.Por ultimo no levanta 3G en la operadora donde lo tengo (movistar Venezuela), pero ya debe ser problema de la operadora, aunque el equipo deberia levantar 3G con cualquiera que tenga este tipo de tecnologia.","706","BlackBerry","4"

The phone was announced as new when I bought it in early January 2012. To my surprise, and when the box came to me the first thing I've found is that the box is not original Blackberry. Without the usual accessories, handsfree or 2Gb memory nor the original manual in the box came the phone that apparently looks back with your battery and the back cover and the wall charger. Currently works without a problem and besides having the necessary 3G band for my telephone operator as requested. I strongly recommend to read carefully all the information and descriptions posted by the seller in the Amazon product page so you can be sure of what you buy. I discourage shopping online as in telephone coversacion exprece my desire for a new mobile phone, not refurbished.

I understand that I bought a used phone, but it was described as being in ""good"" condition. If good condition means a battery that won't charge properly (has never fully charged, and it actually loses power when plugged in at times), a time setting that changes at random (my alarm was set for 7:30 am, so I could get some sleep before my final exam. The phone changed time zones and I was woken up at 3:30 am.), the apps I downloaded suddenly disappear, the casing was falling off, the plug that was sent along with the phone to recharge it has cable exposed. and the phone shuts off at random, often.What is worst, is that the seller is completely unprofessional and unhelpful. I have written SO MANY e-mails to this person asking for them to help resolve the problem- all the replies I have gotten have been late and really unhelpful. The seller wouldn't even write his name after he replied. Although the phone itself is clearly messed up, he asked me to send it back so I could get the replacement I asked for. This was really fishy, so I asked him to please send a replacement battery instead, as I didn't trust the situation. I never got the battery. The situation had already been dragging on for weeks, and I hardly heard back from him, so I wrote a negative review. He asked me to take this off of Amazon, and promised to send a replacement. I agreed. Did I ever get the phone? No. And I don't expect I will.Don't waste your time and money with this company. If you are going to make an investment in a product like this, at least make sure you are dealing with more reliable people who actually care about customer satisfaction.","706","BlackBerry","4"

Everything works perfectly.Yes, to be able to configure your mail, twitter, facebook, blackberry messenger, and all the rest of the services the phone has, you need to enable the blackberry services with your provider (yes, you need to pay).I am not too informed about band systems for phones but since it worked here, I would assume it works with GSM 850/900/1800/1900MHz and HDSPA (3G) 2100MHz/1900MHz/850MHz.I read on the reviews this was the T-Mobile version.

The phone does look brand new and currently works without any problems. It better stay that way considering how much $$$$ is splashed out for the device!!!!So after about one month, the key pad especially the BB button started malfunctioning. I tried to return the phone unfortunately, becos i moved to Africa shortly after the purchase, US customs made it difficult to return to seller. So i decided to cut my losses and buy a new key pad which i did. It worked better although for the BB button, it was still faulty. I then realized it was a problem not of the key pad, but in the underlying board.So i've had to live and struggle with the phone until yesterday when the screen went crazy.

Strangely you have not addressed my questions, the most important being whether what was sold to me was a new product as advertised. Instead of addressing questions clearly raised, you have chosen to side track and not respond to questions asked. This kind off attitude will certainly reflect very badly on a trusted site such as amazon. As stated earlier this phone did not work properly from the begining. Also one expect a minimum 1 year or atlest 6 month warranty on new products purchased from a trusted site like amazon.To state ""The return period for this device has expired"" without reason/explaining the return policy in the first place is very un-proffesional to say the least.

They were simply thrown into some bags3.The battery that came with the phone was also unusuable, as it was split open.4.Even the label on the side of the box when compared to another blackberry box seemed as if it was simply scanned, edited and pasted on.Overall i'm EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in this purcahse which i thought was going to be a new unused untouched phone.

Affordable, but packing in a lot of different features and retaining a nice size. While I upgraded to the Nexus 6 (and now Nexus 6P), this device is still being used in my family since its hardware is still working fine and also is upgradable to the very latest Android (Marshmallow or 6).One benefit this has over the new Nexus 5X is that it supports wireless charging, something Google opted out of the 2015 models due to their Type-C USB charging.","126","LG","5"

"4031","LG Google Nexus 5 D821 32GB, 8MP, KitKat, Quad-Core Factory Unlocked - Red - No 4G in USA - International Version No Warranty","455","5","Of all the smartphones I have ever owned, the Nexus 5 definitely is at the top of the list. The phone has a sleek design and it feels great in your hand, with or without a case! I have owned this phone for about six months now and I still love it as much as the first day when I took it out of the box! It still performs great and keeps up very well thanks to it's Snapdragon 800 Quad-core processor. I have only had issues with the phone on an application side when a specific application freezes or doesn't meet expectations.The camera on this phone performs amazingly when there is great lighting and takes some really nice pictures thanks to the HDR+ mode. Like most other cameras, however night time images come out grainy, sadly those pictures are not up to par with other smartphone cameras in the market. Give it great lighting and it produces some really astonishing images for a phone.Google Now really pushes this phone to what smartphones can do with its constant reminders, traffic updates, interests on the internet based off of your search results an voice recognition. By saying ""Okay Google..."" you have access to the entire internet and the applications on your phone by voice command. If you're not using it yet, START!I highly recommend this phone over any other android phone just because of it's clean Android feel. Plus buying it direct from Amazon rather than through your carrier ensures you don't have all those bulky applications that you can't remove!This phone is slightly bigger than my last phone coming in at 4.95 inches vs. my last phone at 3.5 inches. Overall it is slightly bigger and as a female, I already knew it wasn't going to fit in any of my pockets (does fit in my back pocket, just not my front pockets). But I love the added screen real estate so I can't complain.Batter life out of the box is phenomenal and I have been getting two days of use out of one charge, much better than my previous phone. The drawback of the battery is that it is not replaceable but a portable charger works well with it.This phone also works with wireless charging which is really cool. I bought a wireless charger when I bought this phone and it works great. The drawback being that with a case (one that actually protects the phone) the locking positioning doesn't work as well.","126","LG","5"

"4055","LG Google Nexus 5 D821 32GB, 8MP, KitKat, Quad-Core Factory Unlocked - Red - No 4G in USA - International Version No Warranty","455","4","I have been iphone user for 5 straight years now (since 2009 with 3GS, 4S and 5) iOS as you may know can't be customized a lot unless you jailbreak it which will probably make your phone more vulnerable to malware...etc. I got tired of its look through the years although I updated mine to iOS 8 last year. so I purchased nexus 5 since it delivers pure android experience unlike the other manufactures where they fill it with unwanted software and ugly interface and tweaks that makes the phone slower (looking at you Samsung). So I went for the safest choice by buying this phone which offer really great specs considering its low price. But don't be fooled by. the phone have many drawbacks like it's battery which drains really fast if you're heavy user like me (2300mAh) and its slow charging rate (it takes 3 hours to charge to 100%) which pretty much makes you a wall hugger for the most of your day (they solved this issue in nexus 6 with its fast charging and Lollipop update by offering battery saver mode when it reach to 20%). Another drawback is the camera which isn't that great but I don't take photos a lot personally so i can't speak about that much but many people have complained about, another flaw in this phone which I don't see a lot of people talk about is the inconsistency of the OS (heavy apps like chrome for instance crush multiple time and makes the phone seriously unusable unless you restart the phone from time to time, I solved this issue by downloading clean master app from google play which notify me whenever the RAM gets full and I need to clean it up before it makes my phone hard to use) probably this is the problem have just apeared with the introduction of lollipop update since I didn't use android KitKat for a long time. Other than that the phone has just been great and I can't complain much considering its price which Is amazing (remember that google business model is about how munch information they can advertise to you based on how much personal information you give to them not the actual hardware sales). If you can get your hands on the new MOTO X I highly suggest that you buy it instead of the nexus if you value the pure android experience like I am. ( I couldn't because I don't live in north america or europe) talking about this specific seller was not much to complain about since it Arrived fast and at good condition, but surprisingly without earpuds which I found it to be weird.The phone is great and there is not much to complain but you've got to consider its horrible battery and its camera and you have to get used to the OS if it was your first using it like I am. You have got a better alternative now in 2015 like moto x or the new nexus 6 (which I find its 6 inch screen hard to use with one hand)Hope this review helps.","126","LG","5"

This phone I dropped from a foot high and revealed that there is a film over the top of the screen. Peeling off that film continues to crack the screen as you peel. The nexus lettering on the back of the phone as already fallen off ( after 2 weeks) which shouldn't happen anyway and using a program causes it to majorly overheat near the camera.

(When the phone goes to keep and has to be fully restarted). Not good since I live in the mountains and you kind of need a phone here. I got the 5 a couple of days ago and its and almost perfect phone except:1. Lollipop iis one of the most buggiest op sys I have ever used. Kit Kat was perfect, almost no lagging, apps wouldn't crash. Slight lag in 5.0 also so apps crash frequently.2. Battery life is terrible, I've DL an app for the battery but it leaves a lot to be desired.3. I'm sorry, but I expected a more powerful camera on and expensive device such as this.Other than that, does give you the pure stock android experience, a processor that can handle pretty much and game you throw at it, latest system updates.

"4129","LG Google Nexus 5 D821 32GB, 8MP, KitKat, Quad-Core Factory Unlocked - Red - No 4G in USA - International Version No Warranty","455","5","Of all the smartphones I have ever owned, the Nexus 5 definitely is at the top of the list. The phone has a sleek design and it feels great in your hand, with or without a case! I have owned this phone for about six months now and I still love it as much as the first day when I took it out of the box! It still performs great and keeps up very well thanks to it's Snapdragon 800 Quad-core processor. I have only had issues with the phone on an application side when a specific application freezes or doesn't meet expectations.The camera on this phone performs amazingly when there is great lighting and takes some really nice pictures thanks to the HDR+ mode. Like most other cameras, however night time images come out grainy, sadly those pictures are not up to par with other smartphone cameras in the market. Give it great lighting and it produces some really astonishing images for a phone.Google Now really pushes this phone to what smartphones can do with its constant reminders, traffic updates, interests on the internet based off of your search results an voice recognition. By saying ""Okay Google..."" you have access to the entire internet and the applications on your phone by voice command. If you're not using it yet, START!I highly recommend this phone over any other android phone just because of it's clean Android feel. Plus buying it direct from Amazon rather than through your carrier ensures you don't have all those bulky applications that you can't remove!This phone is slightly bigger than my last phone coming in at 4.95 inches vs. my last phone at 3.5 inches. Overall it is slightly bigger and as a female, I already knew it wasn't going to fit in any of my pockets (does fit in my back pocket, just not my front pockets). But I love the added screen real estate so I can't complain.Batter life out of the box is phenomenal and I have been getting two days of use out of one charge, much better than my previous phone. The drawback of the battery is that it is not replaceable but a portable charger works well with it.This phone also works with wireless charging which is really cool. I bought a wireless charger when I bought this phone and it works great. The drawback being that with a case (one that actually protects the phone) the locking positioning doesn't work as well.","126","LG","5"

When I contacted the seller they told me: ""Hello you do have a warranty with LG and you can contact them for replacement."" So I did, I contacted LG, they told me to reset the phone to factory settings, and that work for like a week, but then started to fail again. Then I contacted LG again and they told me:""Good Day!

"4143","LG Google Nexus 5 D821 Factory Unlocked Phone, 32GB, Black - No 4G in USA - International Version No Warranty","169.89","4","I have been iphone user for 5 straight years now (since 2009 with 3GS, 4S and 5) iOS as you may know can't be customized a lot unless you jailbreak it which will probably make your phone more vulnerable to malware...etc. I got tired of its look through the years although I updated mine to iOS 8 last year. so I purchased nexus 5 since it delivers pure android experience unlike the other manufactures where they fill it with unwanted software and ugly interface and tweaks that makes the phone slower (looking at you Samsung). So I went for the safest choice by buying this phone which offer really great specs considering its low price. But don't be fooled by. the phone have many drawbacks like it's battery which drains really fast if you're heavy user like me (2300mAh) and its slow charging rate (it takes 3 hours to charge to 100%) which pretty much makes you a wall hugger for the most of your day (they solved this issue in nexus 6 with its fast charging and Lollipop update by offering battery saver mode when it reach to 20%). Another drawback is the camera which isn't that great but I don't take photos a lot personally so i can't speak about that much but many people have complained about, another flaw in this phone which I don't see a lot of people talk about is the inconsistency of the OS (heavy apps like chrome for instance crush multiple time and makes the phone seriously unusable unless you restart the phone from time to time, I solved this issue by downloading clean master app from google play which notify me whenever the RAM gets full and I need to clean it up before it makes my phone hard to use) probably this is the problem have just apeared with the introduction of lollipop update since I didn't use android KitKat for a long time. Other than that the phone has just been great and I can't complain much considering its price which Is amazing (remember that google business model is about how munch information they can advertise to you based on how much personal information you give to them not the actual hardware sales). If you can get your hands on the new MOTO X I highly suggest that you buy it instead of the nexus if you value the pure android experience like I am. ( I couldn't because I don't live in north america or europe) talking about this specific seller was not much to complain about since it Arrived fast and at good condition, but surprisingly without earpuds which I found it to be weird.The phone is great and there is not much to complain but you've got to consider its horrible battery and its camera and you have to get used to the OS if it was your first using it like I am. You have got a better alternative now in 2015 like moto x or the new nexus 6 (which I find its 6 inch screen hard to use with one hand)Hope this review helps.","158","LG","5"

"4207","LG Google Nexus 5 D821 Factory Unlocked Phone, 32GB, Black - No 4G in USA - International Version No Warranty","169.89","5","Of all the smartphones I have ever owned, the Nexus 5 definitely is at the top of the list. The phone has a sleek design and it feels great in your hand, with or without a case! I have owned this phone for about six months now and I still love it as much as the first day when I took it out of the box! It still performs great and keeps up very well thanks to it's Snapdragon 800 Quad-core processor. I have only had issues with the phone on an application side when a specific application freezes or doesn't meet expectations.The camera on this phone performs amazingly when there is great lighting and takes some really nice pictures thanks to the HDR+ mode. Like most other cameras, however night time images come out grainy, sadly those pictures are not up to par with other smartphone cameras in the market. Give it great lighting and it produces some really astonishing images for a phone.Google Now really pushes this phone to what smartphones can do with its constant reminders, traffic updates, interests on the internet based off of your search results an voice recognition. By saying ""Okay Google..."" you have access to the entire internet and the applications on your phone by voice command. If you're not using it yet, START!I highly recommend this phone over any other android phone just because of it's clean Android feel. Plus buying it direct from Amazon rather than through your carrier ensures you don't have all those bulky applications that you can't remove!This phone is slightly bigger than my last phone coming in at 4.95 inches vs. my last phone at 3.5 inches. Overall it is slightly bigger and as a female, I already knew it wasn't going to fit in any of my pockets (does fit in my back pocket, just not my front pockets). But I love the added screen real estate so I can't complain.Batter life out of the box is phenomenal and I have been getting two days of use out of one charge, much better than my previous phone. The drawback of the battery is that it is not replaceable but a portable charger works well with it.This phone also works with wireless charging which is really cool. I bought a wireless charger when I bought this phone and it works great. The drawback being that with a case (one that actually protects the phone) the locking positioning doesn't work as well.","158","LG","5"

I was aware of this before purchasing the item but I also expected the item to last longer than a couple of weeks before cracking.

This phone I dropped from a foot high and revealed that there is a film over the top of the screen. Peeling off that film continues to crack the screen as you peel. The nexus lettering on the back of the phone as already fallen off ( after 2 weeks) which shouldn't happen anyway and using a program causes it to majorly overheat near the camera.

(When the phone goes to keep and has to be fully restarted). Not good since I live in the mountains and you kind of need a phone here. I got the 5 a couple of days ago and its and almost perfect phone except:1. Lollipop iis one of the most buggiest op sys I have ever used. Kit Kat was perfect, almost no lagging, apps wouldn't crash. Slight lag in 5.0 also so apps crash frequently.2. Battery life is terrible, I've DL an app for the battery but it leaves a lot to be desired.3. I'm sorry, but I expected a more powerful camera on and expensive device such as this.Other than that, does give you the pure stock android experience, a processor that can handle pretty much and game you throw at it, latest system updates. All in all, a pretty good deal considering the hardware under the hood.","158","LG","5"

"4281","LG Google Nexus 5 D821 Factory Unlocked Phone, 32GB, Black - No 4G in USA - International Version No Warranty","169.89","4","I have been iphone user for 5 straight years now (since 2009 with 3GS, 4S and 5) iOS as you may know can't be customized a lot unless you jailbreak it which will probably make your phone more vulnerable to malware...etc. I got tired of its look through the years although I updated mine to iOS 8 last year. so I purchased nexus 5 since it delivers pure android experience unlike the other manufactures where they fill it with unwanted software and ugly interface and tweaks that makes the phone slower (looking at you Samsung). So I went for the safest choice by buying this phone which offer really great specs considering its low price. But don't be fooled by. the phone have many drawbacks like it's battery which drains really fast if you're heavy user like me (2300mAh) and its slow charging rate (it takes 3 hours to charge to 100%) which pretty much makes you a wall hugger for the most of your day (they solved this issue in nexus 6 with its fast charging and Lollipop update by offering battery saver mode when it reach to 20%). Another drawback is the camera which isn't that great but I don't take photos a lot personally so i can't speak about that much but many people have complained about, another flaw in this phone which I don't see a lot of people talk about is the inconsistency of the OS (heavy apps like chrome for instance crush multiple time and makes the phone seriously unusable unless you restart the phone from time to time, I solved this issue by downloading clean master app from google play which notify me whenever the RAM gets full and I need to clean it up before it makes my phone hard to use) probably this is the problem have just apeared with the introduction of lollipop update since I didn't use android KitKat for a long time. Other than that the phone has just been great and I can't complain much considering its price which Is amazing (remember that google business model is about how munch information they can advertise to you based on how much personal information you give to them not the actual hardware sales). If you can get your hands on the new MOTO X I highly suggest that you buy it instead of the nexus if you value the pure android experience like I am. ( I couldn't because I don't live in north america or europe) talking about this specific seller was not much to complain about since it Arrived fast and at good condition, but surprisingly without earpuds which I found it to be weird.The phone is great and there is not much to complain but you've got to consider its horrible battery and its camera and you have to get used to the OS if it was your first using it like I am. You have got a better alternative now in 2015 like moto x or the new nexus 6 (which I find its 6 inch screen hard to use with one hand)Hope this review helps.","158","LG","5"

I've searched message boards and some other people have the same problem but no solution.I don't recall seeing the ""No Warranty"" language when I made the purchase in October 2014. Seller said there is no One Year Warranty with this phone.This is not a review of the type of phone in general. It worked fine in the first few months. Just make sure you buy it from Google directly so that it will come with a warranty.11/11/15 Follow Up: I replaced the battery and that fixed the malfunction problem. The original battery had swelled up like it was about to burst. But now, it will not work as a phone due to our TMobile network switching to 4G.

"4338","LG Google Nexus 5 D821 Factory Unlocked, 16GB, White - No 4G in USA - International Version No Warranty","257.77","3","The price was right on this one, but I have some complaints. The camera quality is not very good unless the lighting is very good. The delay in snapping the shot means you miss a lot of perfect moments. It is easy to get blurry or grainy shots. The volume is a bit better than my iPhone 4 had been, but there's a lot of ""fuzz"" to the sound at higher volumes. I work in a building that doesn't have great coverage from my carrier, and this phone doesn't have Wi-Fi calling. That's a real problem. These are the biggest negatives. I like the screen size and the size of the phone. It is generous without the phone being huge. Overall I like it. But I don't love it.","342","LG","5"

Its got great features and I love it more than any other Android or iPhone. Good processor with amazing RAM capabilities. Games are smooth, Camera is awesome, people say that its not sufficient, but trust me its more than sufficient for normal user. If you are photography enthusiast then probably taking pics with a phone is foolish. But it captures the moments perfectly. All in all Google Nexus 5 rules and Seller is trustworthy.","342","LG","5"

I think a lot of people appreciate the pure android after trying crapware ridden samsung's and such. There's absolutely nothing to complain about in this fast and most modern phone except camera. The pictures are significantly lower quality than iPhone and Galaxy S4/5. The flash is only useful for a flashlight at all - it disappears before the shot is taken (tried on 2 phones). Though as of 7/31/2014, OnePlus One is reportedly a better deal. You can buy an invite on forums for $30, and then resell 3 invites you'll get for $50 each on eBay. So it will cost you only $200 for a 64gb 5.5"" phone.","342","LG","5"

"4420","LG Google Nexus 5 D821 Factory Unlocked, 16GB, White - No 4G in USA - International Version No Warranty","257.77","5","This phone is gorgeous, it's elegant, easy to use and runs extremely fast. I used to be an Apple fan, so I list some comparison to iOS devices:1. Gesture typing : when you move along the keyboard the whole word with space will be typed for you, It's incrediblely convenient and make typing incrediblely fast and easy.2. Keyboard : it's, like a computer, has number keys and most symbols upfront, and it's easier than computer that you don't need shift key but simply hold longer or tilt a bit instead. Also the cap lock locks to capitals even when you move from one section to another. Avoided all frustration on iOS.3. Cursor: unlike iOS for the frustration of putting your finger on right spot for copy paste and correction, this phone use cursor which is so easy to control.4. Printing: it automatically set my home printer as default so l can print right away.5. Google: it automatically connect to all my Google accounts.6. Native YouTube support avoid all limitation with YouTube on iOS.7. NFC seems more fully functional.8. Voice is more applicable in voice typing, searching, etc.9. Synch with Windows system as easy as a USB drive.10. Standard connection,I can charge it with Kindle USB cable.11. Google map is so much better than iOS map. But I also installed another map for real GPS to avoid using data. This is not as convenience as Nokia Windows phone.12. Open Android OS, can get Android latest release once it's released, I'm using Android 5 already. Also easy to write your own apps. This is an advantage over other Android phone such as Samsung Galaxy.Drawbacks(you can install or even write an app to fix them):1. No undo for typing so if you accidentally delete some typing you have to retype it. Fortunately above mentioned feature make typing so easy that this drawback is not as bad as it sounds to be.2. The build-in foreign language keyboard support is not as complete as iOS. Install an App if needed.3. apps are allowed to access sensitive data. Watch out app disclosure or install a security app.4. Synch with Mac book is not strait forward,I didn't try the available app, but use Windows PC to copy all file to external hard drive instead.5. While gmail seems perfect, other mail lack of search capability, I have to install an app for other mail. Don't know why Google can't fix it. Well, but iPhone iPad has even worse issue with some email carriers.This phone is brand new fast delivery, a lot of thanks to the seller. But be aware that the warranty is in Chinese, and so is the quick start instruction, the later is not an isssue because you can easily find instruction on web. I would suggest the seller prepare an English version for buyer's convenience.","342","LG","5"

So far, the phone is working well and wasn't DOA. However, the inner box itself had a white sticker on both sides (which could have been generic - nothing to indicate LG or Google) and the outer blue cover with the NEXUS logo wasn't sealed to the box. The phone was in Japanese upon startup and the phone had already 2 text messages (dated 26 Aug) from YMobile suggesting someone must have got it free from them and sold it off onto amazon resellers. So I am slighty taken aback by this. I thought the phone was supposed to be brand new?","342","LG","5"

I used a free trial version of an app to do it just once once and since then, I'm only using Google calender and contacts (and very pleased). Not everything was synced properly, so it all had to be checked and corrected manually.- The shape of the charger plug is wrong for my country's electric sockets. I got the one that fits the socket in UK and had to go out and buy an adapter (about 2-5$). Would be great if the buyer could choose the type of socket.- Price is little bit higher then straight from Google Play, but they do not service my country yet.All in all a very good buy!","342","LG","5"

All of them say it's great. The reason why I have a low grade on this is because the seller is sell the phone new, but when I first opened the package I could tell it was opened before me. The first sign was that the sealing sticker were broke and someone else placed new stickers on top of the old ones. The second sign was there was small flakes of something on top of the phone and no dust cover on the phone. (Google always had that on all their devices) The phone also didn't come with a pin to open the Sim card holder and it came with a charger met the UK. The third sign was the phone had already been set to UK English and I couldn't set up on a US cell server. I was on the phone with Google for a good hour trying to figure this out. To top it off I was getting maximum 6 hours out of the phone per charge. I love the phone just not this seller.","342","LG","5"

I run a YouTube channel about tech and my Nexus 5 was my lifeline. I kept it in the most pristine condition and up and out of nowhere it completely stops working. Did I mention that It looked like my box was Pre Opened before I got it. To keep things sweet and to the point the Nexus 5 is a great phone. The seller selling it on the other hand needs to be more honest about which model people are paying for and ensure that that is the CORRECT one. I will probably not return to the seller to buy another device.","342","LG","5"

"4611","LG Google Nexus 5 D821 Factory Unlocked, 16GB, White - No 4G in USA - International Version No Warranty","257.77","2","The reason I'm giving two stars instead of one is due to error on my part. I didn't realize that this is the international model for the Nexus 5 when I ordered the phone. To my surprise, I opened the package to find a USB plug-in adapter made for an international outlet and a manual primarily printed in French. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE IF YOU LIVE IN THE U.S!! The D820 model is for the U.S , and the D821 is for everywhere else. While it was my fault that I didn't notice this, I believe that ""The Wireless Circle"" did a piss-poor job at letting customers know what kind of phone this is. Every other international phone that I've seen has said ""International Version"" in the name or in the specifications. This trickery almost seems intentional, scumbags. Now I get to pay a 20% restocking fee to send this lovely useless phone back to the company! :)","342","LG","5"

The camera quality is not very good unless the lighting is very good. The delay in snapping the shot means you miss a lot of perfect moments. It is easy to get blurry or grainy shots. The volume is a bit better than my iPhone 4 had been, but there's a lot of ""fuzz"" to the sound at higher volumes. I work in a building that doesn't have great coverage from my carrier, and this phone doesn't have Wi-Fi calling. That's a real problem. These are the biggest negatives. I like the screen size and the size of the phone. It is generous without the phone being huge. Overall I like it. But I don't love it.","342","LG","5"

It has worked well for the time I have had it (2 months). The downside is the battery life (less than 8 hrs); weight and the fact that it is difficult (slow) to turn on and reluctant to turn off. I have tried to shut it down at night only to find it still on in the morning with the battery depleted. I don't understand why selecting SHUT DOWN followed by a confirmation that it is shutting down doesn't turn it off!","502","Motorola","6"

"4690","Motorola Droid 2 A955 Verizon Phone 5MP Cam, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth","82","4","Update: I factory reset my phone and it works much better. I am guessing that they had an app that was pre installed that made it freeze so much. I am use to a bigger screen, but for the price its good.th only reason i am giving this product two stars is because its definitely not the sellers fault.The pros: the querty keyboard is nice. The phone arrived in a timely manner and was in great shape. No complaints there.The cons: the phone freezes all the dang time. It will freeze in the middle of typing a text and just go crazy. I've made phone calls and it would freeze and it merge phone calls, call other people, hang up on the person I was talking to and I have to take out the battery to get it back to normal. It also does this while texting. Here I am, pooring my heart out at my finger tips and suddenly its going to voice command and im yelling at my phone, again taking out the battery. The apps will cause it to freeze or just not open at all. I love kindle... its my biggest reason to have a smart phone... can't use it. It freezes completely or takes forever to open.I was so sad the phone was such a bum. The price was great, but I have had several phones and this one has been the worst hands down.

I wish there was a designated number row on the QWERTY keyboard, and I wish the keyboard backlight was brighter, but overall I'm very happy with this phone. I read lots of reviews for CDMA phones, and this was the best-rated smart phone. And it's 3G (which is what I wanted, because that works best on my carrier, Page Plus), and a model that was several years old, so it was a fantastic deal. I got it refurbished, so was nervous about how the phone would function, but it works great. The screen is vibrant and beautiful, and lots of fun apps through Google Play. I'm on Page Plus, and this phone is totally compatible. So far I am in love with my new phone.","502","Motorola","6"

"4704","Motorola Droid 2 A955 Verizon Phone 5MP Cam, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth","82","2","Was listed as refurbished, but frame had small crack upon arrival. I had an old Droid R2D2, which I really liked, a few years ago. This was almost the same phone, just black case and no stickers. I hooked this up to Tracfone, and it would not stay connected to their network. Screen quickly got scratched, missed phone calls, missed e-mails, had to reconnect every day or every other day. Spent hours on the phone with Tracfone until we figured out a way to reconnect it (had to dial access codes). Got very slow to respond, 3-4 minutes would wait to place a call (press the phone button, dial the phone, hit send and wait). I can blame some of this on Tracfone, but hooked up a different old phone (but about same era) this week with no problems. Stays connected, places and receives calls, gets and sends e-mails and texts.. I used this phone for about 6 months, and still have fond memories about my R2D2 phone, but this one was not well refurbished, and I think had some internal problems as would not work.","502","Motorola","6"

"4711","Motorola Droid 2 A955 Verizon Phone 5MP Cam, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth","82","1","I received a phone that can barely make calls.The proximity sensor keeps turning the screen black when the phone is away from my head. This makes it impossible to use phone menus (e.g. ""push 1 for english""). I downloaded an app called Test Your Android and found that the proximity sensor reads a constant 3cm distance unless I gently push on the glass below the speaker hole (right where it says Motorola). Then the proximity sensor reads 100cm until I wave my hand in front of it and it reads 3cm. I verified this during a phone call. With gentle pressure on the glass, while keeping fingers away from the sensor, the proximity sensor works.With the Test Your Android app I also discovered that:The far left edge of the touch screen is not working all of the time.The compass doesn't work consistently (even after calibrating).","502","Motorola","6"

"4716","Motorola Droid 2 A955 Verizon Phone 5MP Cam, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth","82","3","This is my first Droid phone and a big difference from my Windows phone. I prefer the Windows live tile format but like that the Droid has access to more apps. This phone will not allow you to sync a yahoo email account while on a wi-fi connection which really sucks. IMO it's because they want to force you into Gmail. It also keeps vibrating and lighting up for ""alerts"" but I can't ever seem to find what it's alerting me to. There are no new messages which is all I really care to be alerted for. The packaging says that a micro SD memory card is included but it is not and you will need to purchase and install in order to take photos on your phone. The phone was super easy to set up on the Verizon network and did automatically import all of the contacts I'd backed up on my old phone.","502","Motorola","6"
"4717","Motorola Droid 2 A955 Verizon Phone 5MP Cam, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth","82","4","I bought this phone used from riskandrew seller and he is an awesome seller, shipping was a little delayed but only because of hurricane. There are no scratches on the body or screen, so he was honest about the condition of it. Now to the phone itself it lags sometimes but only occasionally and wont let me text while on a call like my old basic phone, but that isn't that serious. The battery life is a tragedy but if you turn of the gps, back round data and wifi it is average. Around 8 hours. I've had it for about a week and its working fine, the camera is pretty good in the write lighting but the flash messes up at times. The sound quality is outstanding, but the keyboard slides choppily, might just be this individual phone. I'm very clumsy and have dropped it on the gym floor, my house tile, in the grass, on my bathroom floor, and nothing happened. I takes so long to power up and if you take a picture by yourself it'll make a sound even on silent. You will have to go into settings to turn of vibrations because it'll vibrate even if on silent.

He told me a few days ago that the battery will not charge. This seller tells me that they are not responsible since their warranty is 90 days and I was a few days past that time when I informed them. I guess I was wrong in assuming that a NEW phone would have a one-year manufacturer's warranty, as is standard with every NEW phone I have purchased previously. Now I'm wondering whether the phone really was NEW. Now that I look back on the order, I don't see any mention of warranty--I guess that is a deliberate omission by Amazon.

"4773","Motorola Droid 2 A955 Verizon Phone 5MP Cam, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth","82","1","The phone lags terribly. The speaker mutes itself during calls about one minute in. The phone often won't send a call after dialing, then sends the call after you've given up and moved on to other things. The phone spontaneously dials numbers from the contact list at other times. The texting doesn't work properly and often receives multiple copies of incoming texts. There is no way to remove obsolete applications that come on the device, such a the Blockbuster app, and current updated apps often do not work properly, from closing prematurely to frequent freezing to not receiving incoming information at all.Do not buy this phone. You will regret it.","502","Motorola","6"

Then multiple buttons on the keyboard stopped working, and soon it was just shutting off and restarting randomly, daily.Currently using an LG G2 and I've had it for far longer than I had the Droid 2.

"4781","Motorola Droid 2 A955 Verizon Phone 5MP Cam, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth","82","2","I got this phone to replace a Droid Bionic that went boom after a couple years. For the $39.95 I got it used, I gotta say it was a little above what I was expecting, but not too much. Not sure if most Droids do this, but I didn't know hitting the home button brought up voice command which got a bit annoying; I eventually stopped hitting it 10 times a second and it was fine. The screen was a bit phantom; it would do the most random things and type gibberish; I cleaned the screen off with an alcohol pad and it was working fine. Although I feel I shouldn't have to alcohol swab it every day or two. All in all, I had to improvise a bit, but ultimately it's actually a pretty decent phone for an older droid.Now, this is what grinded my gears a lot. I had this phone for about TEN (10) days before it just broke without warning. I opened up the keyboard, only to have the touchscreen portion COMPLETELY DETACH without any warning and HANG, attached to a cable, which, after a second or two, just detached. As a result, the touch screen tumbled down onto the metallic trucks of my skateboard, shattering and disfiguring it from the angle/impact. Either something was loose, or I have some kind of Hulk strength. I'm sending it back to Amazon, though I'm not expecting a return or refund since the phone is literally disfigured and in 2 different parts. The only real concern I have is: HOW. DOES.THIS.HAPPEN.","502","Motorola","6"

"4795","Motorola Droid 2 A955 Verizon Phone 5MP Cam, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth","82","4","The battery life is very good on this phone. Even with internet on and facebook notifications going off all day, it still retains a good deal of battery life. I'm sure I can get at least 24 hours out of this phone with heavy use before the phone runs out of power.There is one problem however, and that is that you do get what you pay for. $70 for an amazing phone like this does come at a cost- and that is that this phone lags, glitches, and randomly reboots a lot. Not that it feels slow or anything- it's really fast when doing a task or two, but fill it up with a full arsenal of today's most popular social apps though, and you *will* feel the drag of having only 512 mb of ram. My Nokia n900 can handle a *huge* amount of simultaneous windows all open at once with no lag, and it's partly due to the fact that it has 1Gb of ram. With the tremendous weight of apps these days, 512Mb is barely enough for doing two or three things at once.It sucks living in 2014 because developers all over the world are making ""ipads"" and the latest ""iphones"" the standard for whom they develop their web pages and applications. Us stubborn folk who are stuck in 2008 are stuck with a slow laggy internet experience as a result of the sheer amount of javascript and/or ajax that they cram into everything these days.Nonetheless, I don't feel disappointed from my phone. It exceeded my expectations of what I would get for only 70 dollars. If you need something that can handle tremendous amounts of multitasking though, do your research and find a smartphone with at least 1gig of RAM and avoid anything with less.","502","Motorola","6"

I don't know if this is reflective of the phone ( i know others who have it & don't seem to have difficulties) or the source (I purchased 2 phones and they are both having issues - maybe it was a ""second""/subptimal one which is how Electronic Warehouse got it (vs going to Verizon)).

"4847","Motorola Droid 2 A955 Verizon Phone 5MP Cam, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth","82","5","I bought this for my teenage daughter along with a 16gb sd card for $20.So for well under $100 she has a decent first smartphone.She uses it to read books on the Kindle app,she downloaded a mp3 type app and now downloads and listens to music via headphones(constantly:-))goes on facebook,take photos and videos,texts and calls of course and play a couple games she likes.So she's not a heavy user like her dad.This phone wont handle too many running widgets but it does play games good,run live wallpapers if you're into that and search the web okay.It has a 4 row qwerty (the top row has the numbers as well as the qwerty row) a removable battery (why manufacturers are making them these days without a keyboard or interchangeable batteries is beyond me) and a flash foe the camera and digital recorder.It's not a bad phone at all for the price just don't put too much strain on it,one task at a time and it works and looks good.For the price I definitely recommend it,just know that it doesn't come close to the phones coming out today as far as power.But the phones coming out today will be the same way in a couple years,they basically get 'old' in roughly 6 months so you have to watch what software you downloadIt does basically the same things as brand new phones just not as fast.Google Maps,no problem,Google searches also no problem.A decent phone especially for a first smartphone.I'm telling you,my daughter is very happy with it and that's what I wanted.I guess she can multi task with it with some things cause after she gets done with her homework more often than not she can be found with her headphones on listening to her music app while also reading from her Kindle app.I honestly don't know why there's so many negative reviews,I have a new and powerful smartphone and her Droid 2 will literally do almost everything mine does.The Droid 2 just can't run as many things at once as my phone but if they're done one at a time there's no problems.It can do basically everything and do it for a quarter the price.I haven't checked current prices but I bought my daughters Droid 2 a couple months ago via Amazon for $64.99 then got her a bigger sd card than mine also via Amazon for half what I paid for mine out of the store.So her Droid 2 can actually store a lot more info than my new phone can because she has a 16gb card and I have an 8gb.If you're new to these phones and not familiar with digital storage even 8gb is a lot.With an 8gb sd card combined with my phones internal memory I've downloaded over 250 apps not including what comes preinstalled,I've taken over 750 photos that are still stored in my phone,over an hour of video and lots of other stuff and I still have memory left.Also,if this is your first smartphone you'll probably be like most everybody else and get lots of cool apps,some of them cost money but once you buy them they're always yours even if you switch phones.Just sign up your new phone with the same email address and you can put all your paid apps on your new phone without paying again.I was so relieved when I found that out:-)I hope that helps,the Droid 2 is a really good phone for what they're asking here.I would recommend getting an extra charger for your car,they're like $3 here on Amazon,and also get a good protective cover.They make todays phone very fragile on purpose I imagine so we're forced to buy new ones in the event we drop them one too many times.My first cell phone I had back in the 90's was made like a brick,I could have literally dropped it off a roof and it would have been okay.You don't want to hop out of your car with your phone in your lap with today's phones,that's how I broke my last one:-)Droid 2 is a great starter smartphone in my opinion.","502","Motorola","6"
"4848","Motorola Droid 2 A955 Verizon Phone 5MP Cam, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth","82","5","My wife has the A855 Droid. Her's is nice, but slow. There aren't any issues with her's at all. I bought a used Droid 2 A955 from Amazon Warehouse. It was 76.99$. I am very happy with it. Even though it's used, it looks new to me and it runs just fine. It came with a new battery and a USB/Wall charger combo.Again, this model is faster than the 855 and I am very pleased with the signal strength and over all functionality of the phone. I've read almost every review on this phone and there are only 2 comments I have in response to all the good and bad reviews.1. Either people are extremely stupid and don't have any idea on how to use there hands and brains at the same time. Or...2. 50% of the phones that are ordered are bad while the other 50% are good. Which is a terrible ratio.I really hope it's #2, but for some reason I doubt that is entirely true. Anyway, there is nothing wrong with the phone I ordered. I used it as a pay by month phone and the service I get basically rides Verizon's network.I truly hope this helps someone make a choice in whether to purchase this or not. My suggestion: Don't buy it if all you are looking for is a touch screen. I bought this because of the slide out keyboard. It's heavy due to that.Cheers.","502","Motorola","6"

"4870","Motorola Droid 2 A955 Verizon Phone 5MP Cam, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth","82","1","UPDATE 1/6/2014: Updated my review to 1 star. 3 months of use and the phone is now completely bricked. It could never connect to VZW 3G Network and now I cannot even make calls or receive them. *228 activation brings Metro PCS options and not Verizon. Took it up to a local VZW store for a second time and they said the phone is completely malfunctioned and there's nothing they can do about it. Complete and utter bust.------Bought this after I lost my Droid4 (VZW). I haven't been able to connect to VZW's 3G network since purchasing. I've taken it to a VZW store, tried multiple things on my own, and been on with VZW support multiple times. No 3G whatsoever. Regardless of whether its the phone's fault or VZW's, the customer is screwed at the end of the day.There's a little blue triangle in the notification bar which according to VZW support signifies the phone is in roaming mode. For me, the little blue triangle never goes away. Altering roaming settings has no effect.Going into the phone's mobile network settings [Settings >> Wireless & network >> Mobile networks] there is no other option except ""System select"". The carriers mobile network (3G) should show up there; it does not. So something is seriously wrong with this phones ability to connect to Verizon's Network.The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because its perfect functional over Wi-Fi, which is acceptable while I decided which new phone to purchase.","502","Motorola","6"

It does not have a missed call beep so i need to get an app for that i guess. Overall this phone is way worth the money.

Make sure you test the entire phone before the 30 days (I did not need to activate it right away- lesson learned.)

The phone allows me to do all the things you would expect from a smart phone. However, it tends to freeze up if you I'm on the FB app, and trying to send/receive texts. The keyboard is too sensitive, as it doubles about 60% of the letters that I type, which is frustrating. I have reverted back to the touch screen for texting, and will only do the keyboard when I have time to edit my texts.

However, I work near downtown but not downtown in and old building and on my lunch time I like to use my cell for calls. In the basement I have to sit in a certain chair to get signal that disconnects after 5 minutes. Upstairs it works a little better. I used to have us cellular and it worked perfect in this old building and everywhere. My friends at work have mostly AT&T and they use the phone with no problems. I went to the Verizon store and they said they do not guarantee their networks, especially on prepay. I believe this phone is good it is just the network that sucks for voice calls.

My friend who works at Verizon saw me using it and said, ""That phone is the worst phone ever, and I used to sell them."" Text notifications will randomly not sound, for no apparent reason. Texting will suddenly not allow you to input any letters.

"4958","Motorola Droid 2 A955 Verizon Phone 5MP Cam, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth","82","1","To summarize: I bought this phone in 2013 when it was already ""old"" because I don't have a lot of money and all I really wanted was something to make phone calls with/text/occasional photo/occasional Google search. I thought buying this model would save me money, but I was wrong. It lasted 2.5 months total and problems began 1 month after I bought it.First problem: there's a huge lag while I'm texting. I use(d) the touch screen to text, not the keypad, as the keypad is genuinely so awkward to use that it is barely functional. Anyway, in the middle of typing a text, the cursor will lag, I won't be able to see the last 2-4 letters I typed, and the autocorrect will kick in, replacing my intended word with all sorts of weird things that don't make sense. Also while texting, the touch screen keyboard will frequently disappear. It's beyond frustrating and it takes a good 60 seconds to type a 1-2 sentence text. This lag is evidently common and it's suggested you install ADW Launcher to fix it. I did, and the problem was exactly the same.Second problem: While on a phone call, the display screen will often disappear and nothing I do will bring it back. This is problematic if, for example, I'm calling my bank's automated service and need to hit ""2"" to get a person. I can't get the touch screen keyboard up, and the slide out keyboard doesn't work. It's also a problem if I'm trying to hang up at the end of a phone call. Usually I have to wait for the other person to hang up, as I'm unable to do it myself.UPDATE: Three months after the above happened, the entire left side of the touch screen stopped working. Apparently this is a common problem and is due to some kind of programming/software issue.I can't wait to never have to use this frustrating piece of junk again.","502","Motorola","6"

A few hours later, another software update was needed, downloaded....and then the device goes into a black screen with tiny white lettering and an error message. Unable to recover from that. Attempted to do some research on online forums and it seems it is a consistent problems with that version of the software update for android on the droid 2. Was able to return with not much fuss.

"4975","Motorola Droid 2 A955 Verizon Phone 5MP Cam, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth","82","5","It was this or the IPhone4S. I preferred the bigger screen and qwerty keyboard. Initially I had a problem with receiving calls, but I contacted the seller, (5 Star) and was advised to dial #228 to update phone to the newest Verizon towers. Voila! Now I receive all my calls. I found that I seldom use the qwerty board since there are so many easier keyboard apps available for android. It's solid and sturdy, call quality is good and I don't have a problem with battery life. I wanted this Froyo system phone so I could one touch root it with Z4Root. I froze all the apps that turn on by themselves with Titanium Pro; that saves a lot of battery life. Since I don't use the qwerty I was admiring the Moto Droid X with no physical keyboard and a bigger screen. I really like this phone and have found it to be very dependable and easy to use.","502","Motorola","6"

We are also doing this off-cycle, so we did not want to spend a small fortune. The original Droid was showing its age by giving us low memory messages. The Droid 2 has enough additional internal memory so that this is no longer happening. In addition, it has a newer version of Android than the old Droid had. The screen is surprisingly clear and the keyboard is definitely improved. The additional memory means that we should no longer see the low memory error messages. The faster processor means that it performs much quicker than the old Droid.This may not be the latest and greatest, but it was the right phone at the right price for us.","502","Motorola","6"

After contacting Verizon support and doing a bunch of trouble shooting the conclusion was met that the internal software of the phone had been reconfigured to call a different activation number other than Verizon's (i.e. Rooted/Jailbroken). I left numerous voicemails on the seller's helpline and never received a return call let alone actually ever talk to a person when I called. I honestly believe this company sends out defective phones in an attempt to get you to keep it till the 30 day return policy expires on it.

"4994","Motorola Droid 2 A955 Verizon Phone 5MP Cam, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth","82","2","Was listed as refurbished, but frame had small crack upon arrival. I had an old Droid R2D2, which I really liked, a few years ago. This was almost the same phone, just black case and no stickers. I hooked this up to Tracfone, and it would not stay connected to their network. Screen quickly got scratched, missed phone calls, missed e-mails, had to reconnect every day or every other day. Spent hours on the phone with Tracfone until we figured out a way to reconnect it (had to dial access codes). Got very slow to respond, 3-4 minutes would wait to place a call (press the phone button, dial the phone, hit send and wait). I can blame some of this on Tracfone, but hooked up a different old phone (but about same era) this week with no problems. Stays connected, places and receives calls, gets and sends e-mails and texts.. I used this phone for about 6 months, and still have fond memories about my R2D2 phone, but this one was not well refurbished, and I think had some internal problems as would not work.","502","Motorola","6"

By buying an older model from Amazon, I have the best plan and a great phone for a much better price. I love that this still has qwerty keyboard, but touchscreen works great. Battery lasts all day, 10 hrs if I use moderately. When the phone arrived I charged it fully without turning it on, then turned it on and used it until it completely died again, recharged, and now charge as needed. Keep the wifi and gps location turned off unless you're using Navigator or can connect to wifi and that helps with battery life. Great phone for the price! I love the google play store.

"5070","Motorola Droid 2 A955 Verizon Phone 5MP Cam, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth","82","4","Update: I factory reset my phone and it works much better. I am guessing that they had an app that was pre installed that made it freeze so much. I am use to a bigger screen, but for the price its good.th only reason i am giving this product two stars is because its definitely not the sellers fault.The pros: the querty keyboard is nice. The phone arrived in a timely manner and was in great shape. No complaints there.The cons: the phone freezes all the dang time. It will freeze in the middle of typing a text and just go crazy. I've made phone calls and it would freeze and it merge phone calls, call other people, hang up on the person I was talking to and I have to take out the battery to get it back to normal. It also does this while texting. Here I am, pooring my heart out at my finger tips and suddenly its going to voice command and im yelling at my phone, again taking out the battery. The apps will cause it to freeze or just not open at all. I love kindle... its my biggest reason to have a smart phone... can't use it. It freezes completely or takes forever to open.I was so sad the phone was such a bum. The price was great, but I have had several phones and this one has been the worst hands down.

I wish there was a designated number row on the QWERTY keyboard, and I wish the keyboard backlight was brighter, but overall I'm very happy with this phone. I read lots of reviews for CDMA phones, and this was the best-rated smart phone. And it's 3G (which is what I wanted, because that works best on my carrier, Page Plus), and a model that was several years old, so it was a fantastic deal. I got it refurbished, so was nervous about how the phone would function, but it works great. The screen is vibrant and beautiful, and lots of fun apps through Google Play. I'm on Page Plus, and this phone is totally compatible. So far I am in love with my new phone.","502","Motorola","6"

"5086","Motorola Droid 2 A955 Verizon Phone 5MP Cam, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth","82","3","This is my first Droid phone and a big difference from my Windows phone. I prefer the Windows live tile format but like that the Droid has access to more apps. This phone will not allow you to sync a yahoo email account while on a wi-fi connection which really sucks. IMO it's because they want to force you into Gmail. It also keeps vibrating and lighting up for ""alerts"" but I can't ever seem to find what it's alerting me to. There are no new messages which is all I really care to be alerted for. The packaging says that a micro SD memory card is included but it is not and you will need to purchase and install in order to take photos on your phone. The phone was super easy to set up on the Verizon network and did automatically import all of the contacts I'd backed up on my old phone.","502","Motorola","6"
"5087","Motorola Droid 2 A955 Verizon Phone 5MP Cam, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth","82","4","I bought this phone used from riskandrew seller and he is an awesome seller, shipping was a little delayed but only because of hurricane. There are no scratches on the body or screen, so he was honest about the condition of it. Now to the phone itself it lags sometimes but only occasionally and wont let me text while on a call like my old basic phone, but that isn't that serious. The battery life is a tragedy but if you turn of the gps, back round data and wifi it is average. Around 8 hours. I've had it for about a week and its working fine, the camera is pretty good in the write lighting but the flash messes up at times. The sound quality is outstanding, but the keyboard slides choppily, might just be this individual phone. I'm very clumsy and have dropped it on the gym floor, my house tile, in the grass, on my bathroom floor, and nothing happened. I takes so long to power up and if you take a picture by yourself it'll make a sound even on silent. You will have to go into settings to turn of vibrations because it'll vibrate even if on silent. Downloading apps is slow at first but gets very fast. Would recommend","502","Motorola","6"

The phone would not charge or boot up, ever, even when connected over 24 hours to a wall charger.

He told me a few days ago that the battery will not charge. This seller tells me that they are not responsible since their warranty is 90 days and I was a few days past that time when I informed them. I guess I was wrong in assuming that a NEW phone would have a one-year manufacturer's warranty, as is standard with every NEW phone I have purchased previously. Now I'm wondering whether the phone really was NEW. Now that I look back on the order, I don't see any mention of warranty--I guess that is a deliberate omission by Amazon.

"5186","Motorola Droid 3 Verizon Xt862 Verizon Cell Phone","99.98999999999999","4","Took me a while to had get this filled in since I had to send the Phone an extra step through getting into my hands.Phone's delivery was fast I should say, around 3-4 days from the Seller to the Forwarding company.The part wherein shipping from the Forwarding company to me was the dreadful thing. It took a while for the Forwarding company (JAC). The weather has currently, been bad here in the Philippines. I guess that's one of the reasons why it took almost 2 weeks to get it here.Let's get on with the Phone. It's my first Android Phone, I mean really. Not a big fan of high end phones, though I've had my fair experiences with the Apple part. The reason why I had to buy this phone was because of the Fact that it's cheap and it's a side slide qwerty keyboard phone.I was quite feeling vexed for the Phone while I was waiting for it. As I was reading reviews and such, I was anxious about the Phone, thinking that I might get a badly used phone. When the confirmation for pickup came, I had to rush off during lunch from the Office, picked up the Package and back. Once I opened the phone, I was surprised that the Phone is in a somehow great, condition. There were some minor things coming from the Phone like the Dent on the lower right side and some scratches on the bezel over the upper right. I guess the Phone took a fall on its side. The screen display state is great, the phone had a flimsy film covering the display when I got it, though it could've been placed by the Seller itself. I have no issues over the back cover.I've read a lot while waiting for the Phone. Issues like the Phone heats up over the lower back portion, phone hangs up or restarts. Short battery life? and other things. The issues for me are the overheating and the short battery life. Bloatware coming from the stock rom of the Phone was cleaned up by rooting and installing a custom rom for it. Which also did help the battery life somehow. While for the Overheating, I've had that toned down a bit by underclocking the cpu. It did lessen the Heat over the back portion while playing games. I'm on the process of doing an undervolting which I'm still trying to figure out how to do.Current state of the Phone right now is great, though I wish that the Battery life would extend for up to 2-3 days. No hangs has ever occurred, there were some slowing at times but it was tolerable.Undervolting should ease the Heating issue over the back portion once I figured out the guide. Will be buying a new battery as well to go with the phone.It's a great phone for me (will be buying another one for my Girl). Thanks to the Seller for giving me an above average used phone. Though I never got an original wall charger and a usb connector (just got generic ones along the package), still, thanks.For those who are interested, do the things below and you have a nice phone:- Buy a new battery or an extended battery if you are buying a used/refurbished phone.- Root and Flash the Phone with a custom Rom to remove the bloatware from the Stock rom and improve battery life. - Do not use an ICS rom as I've been reading. I had mine installed with Steel Droid.- Do an Undervolt - overclock/underclock if you know how to.- buy a case and a screen protector to go with the display.","245","Motorola","6"

"5223","Motorola Droid 3 Verizon Xt862 Verizon Cell Phone","99.98999999999999","1","Update: Motorola is willing to honor warranty and repair phone at no charge based on proof of purchase date.First, the phone did not come with the car charger as advertised. Since it was a replacement phone, I didn't worry about it. The booklet and warrenty information that is in the box with all new phones was missing. Also not a big deal as I was relacing the same type of phone. Now, after 89 days, the phone screen has turned to a gazillion speckles. All attempts to 'reset' the phone have failed.So, if you have $250 to spend on a phone every 90 days, this is the phone for you.Amazon stated their 30 return policy and told me to contact the manufacturer for warrenty. It would be great if I had the warrenty information which was missing fron the box. I am left without a phone, unable to purchase another, no warrenty information, and relying on the charity of Motorola to hopefully make this right...if indeed it is really a NEW phone.","245","Motorola","6"

I contacted the seller, and they refused to take the phone back, and replace it or refund me my money just because it was just a few days after the time the return policy had ended.

"5273","Motorola Droid 3 Verizon Xt862 Verizon Cell Phone","99.98999999999999","4","Took me a while to had get this filled in since I had to send the Phone an extra step through getting into my hands.Phone's delivery was fast I should say, around 3-4 days from the Seller to the Forwarding company.The part wherein shipping from the Forwarding company to me was the dreadful thing. It took a while for the Forwarding company (JAC). The weather has currently, been bad here in the Philippines. I guess that's one of the reasons why it took almost 2 weeks to get it here.Let's get on with the Phone. It's my first Android Phone, I mean really. Not a big fan of high end phones, though I've had my fair experiences with the Apple part. The reason why I had to buy this phone was because of the Fact that it's cheap and it's a side slide qwerty keyboard phone.I was quite feeling vexed for the Phone while I was waiting for it. As I was reading reviews and such, I was anxious about the Phone, thinking that I might get a badly used phone. When the confirmation for pickup came, I had to rush off during lunch from the Office, picked up the Package and back. Once I opened the phone, I was surprised that the Phone is in a somehow great, condition. There were some minor things coming from the Phone like the Dent on the lower right side and some scratches on the bezel over the upper right. I guess the Phone took a fall on its side. The screen display state is great, the phone had a flimsy film covering the display when I got it, though it could've been placed by the Seller itself. I have no issues over the back cover.I've read a lot while waiting for the Phone. Issues like the Phone heats up over the lower back portion, phone hangs up or restarts. Short battery life? and other things. The issues for me are the overheating and the short battery life. Bloatware coming from the stock rom of the Phone was cleaned up by rooting and installing a custom rom for it. Which also did help the battery life somehow. While for the Overheating, I've had that toned down a bit by underclocking the cpu. It did lessen the Heat over the back portion while playing games. I'm on the process of doing an undervolting which I'm still trying to figure out how to do.Current state of the Phone right now is great, though I wish that the Battery life would extend for up to 2-3 days. No hangs has ever occurred, there were some slowing at times but it was tolerable.Undervolting should ease the Heating issue over the back portion once I figured out the guide. Will be buying a new battery as well to go with the phone.It's a great phone for me (will be buying another one for my Girl). Thanks to the Seller for giving me an above average used phone. Though I never got an original wall charger and a usb connector (just got generic ones along the package), still, thanks.For those who are interested, do the things below and you have a nice phone:- Buy a new battery or an extended battery if you are buying a used/refurbished phone.- Root and Flash the Phone with a custom Rom to remove the bloatware from the Stock rom and improve battery life. - Do not use an ICS rom as I've been reading. I had mine installed with Steel Droid.- Do an Undervolt - overclock/underclock if you know how to.- buy a case and a screen protector to go with the display.","245","Motorola","6"

I set up display to shut off after 15s, but it doesn't work. And the light on the phone drains the battery like crazy, so it's kinda imperative that the display would cut off as it should.

Removing the battery for a restart (since the touchscreen doesn't work, can't even choose power off) did fix the issue at first, but within 5 days, the touchscreen is completely failing, even after a restart. Basically, the touchscreen doesn't recognize any actions.However, I do like the phone. The features and price are right. I've ordered another in the hopes it will work correctly - will return the defective one when the new one arrives, as I obviously cannot change to a new ESN until I have both the old one and new one in my possession.So, I'm disappointed the phone I got was defective, but I'm holding out hope it was a fluke that won't happen twice.","245","Motorola","6"

"5392","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","4","I purchase this cell phone for my husband. Why? Because he has killed so many cell phones as of late that our cell phones insurance will no longer insure any phone on his line. Looking over all the cell phones he has loved and some how destroyed I noticed he specially liked the Droid 4. It had good battery life for the super user he is, it had a full keyboard that he likes, and it serves at a hot spot wonderfully for other devices without getting overly hot. I gave this cell phone 4 stars because this is not a newer phone and people I think need to be aware of that if they don't know it already. While it isn't the newest model out, that doesn't mean it isn't a great work horse of a cell phone.

"5415","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","4","overall great phone. had a droid 2 global prior to the droid 4. the droid 4 is very comparable and performs better than the droid 2 global by quite a lot. much faster processing, better internet connectivity, able to play much more internet videos than the droid 2 global, larger screen is nice, love the slider keyboard minus a few alternate keys such as: !, @, which are not user friendly keys when fast typing, and another downer is that the droid 4 lacks the alt lock feature that the droid 2 global has. if motorola would have kept the alt lock feature for the droid 4 keyboard and kept a few keys as primary keys instead of secondary keys which have to be accesed via alt, than this phone would be much better for typing. the other stupid thing motorola did with the droid 4 is made the battery non removable, wtf?! seriously stupid, but the battery life on the droid 4 is better than th droid 2 global, not a whole lot, but by enough to where it is very noticeable, and makes me think that since it only has a little more milli amp hours to it, I think the main difference is the droid 4 is more power efficient than the droid 2 global was.although motorola should have put a much larger battery like the droid maxx has (3500 mah). one othr thing that sucks on the droid 4 compared to the droid 2 global is the flimsy battery cover, at least the droid 2's battery cover is solid sturdy metal with very solid engagement, unlike the flimsy crap plastic cover on the droid 4. another stupid thing motorola did on the droid 4 is the power port location is towards the bottom of the phone on the same side the droid 2's is on, which makes it really difficult to charge while driving since the phone has to sit upside down in the cup holder for the power cord to connect, at least on the droid 2 the charge port was in a much better spot being towards the top of the phone. another downer is that motorola didn't use the corning gorilla glass for the screen on the droid 4 which many of the newer phones now have.motorola also should have made the droid slider phones bodies of aluminum or stainless steel to make them really durable, if you have a slider you know it's gonna be heavier anyways so it may as well be for a good reason, kinda like a chevelle: bad gas mileage for a good reason, lots of horsepower.","341","Motorola","6"

"5425","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","4","This phone would me 5 stars if it were 2012 and maybe 2013 but now in 2015 yikes. I owned the droid bionic, I own the droid ultra and the droid 4 which do I choose as my cell well the droid 4 and here is why , but wait the droid ultra is newer and has to be better in all ways. Yes it is but it sadly became a gaming device I play games on it more than I text and call so when I do want to text and call the battery is dead and I have to wait to charge it and sometimes that can get in the way when you really need to reach someone but anyways, the droid 4 has a qwerty keyboard and its the last droid to have it droid 5 never came out and as a major texter this just blew me away I love it and it feels retro I would say. Droid 4 is a great cell phone but not so much a smart phone here is why it can connect to the 4g lte from verizon but it was a 3g phone so when you turn on your data you droid 4 will lose battery fast like nose dive fast it may only last 6-7 hours and that is with just having it on if your actually using it for youtube or something it will drain faster 4-5 hours maybe less so if you just need to check emails or something quick it will do fine. If you don't turn on the data on it will last 3 days and if you text like 200 messages a day then day and a half of life which is like WHAT ? So for me the droid 4 has better battery life because I turn the data on only when need it so this phone is not for gaming or viewing hulu and such its for calls and text you know what cell phones use to do. Everything else is ok its an old phone but it works quite well like you can use chromecast and hangouts and google drive etc but not everything is ok it shows its age. Its bluetooth seems non existant it can't find my droid ultra it can connect to my chromebook not even with motorola connect my bluetooth speaker won't interact with it my sony smartwatch 2 won't connect to it. I got it and it said it was new and well it was not nothing serious just cosmetic I paid 103 so I think that seems fair saw it for 109 right now so 100 range for a used phone. Now then I have drop it twice now once on the stone floor at work it survived phew and again in the parking lot of the apartmemts where I live survived but there was slight damage thank god that its made of some kind of metal. The biggest scare was wait....ok back story im with verizon and my droid ultra use a nano sim the droid 4 uses a micro sim so it won't fit but with the verizon pre paid package of $45 a month you get sim adapters for the nano sim so put the nano in the micro and tada you can use the older phone. The scare was that I was switching them in and out from the phone every couple of days so days I worked it was in the droid ultra days off it was in the droid 4 so I could play games and stuff on the droid ultra then one those time the sim adapter got stuck inside the droid 4 and I could not get it out the nano sim did get out and I had to destroy the sim adapter with a utility knife that I had pull out a piece and cut it out and repeat then slid a thin piece of paper to see that I got it all out and hoping I did not break my droid 4 bought a new sim adapter MediaDevil Simdevil 3-in-1 SIM Card Adapter Kit (Nano / Micro / Standard) and use it and I could use the droid 4 again and im not gonna switch back and one last thing it has expandable memory so music and photos no prob and the droid ultra does not heck not even the droid turbo or the moto x has that which is a big bummer. I use it for music but its not very loud and will drain the battery so I use the cable that came with the bluetooth speaker and no more worries. Get it now before the price keeps going up if you just want a cell phone with a keyboard and I heard that you can use it with page plus which I have never heard from befrore.","341","Motorola","6"

"5433","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","2","When they first came out, the Droid-4 was exactly what I and many others needed with a slide out keyboard. It was perfect for those of us who can't stand typing on screens. But sadly, as apps continue to be developed this phone and operating system gets more and more obsolete, not able to run many of the modern day apps anymore. Facebook and facebook messenger, for starters. Frequent freeze-ups on the apps, or phone goes unresponsive. I thought it was just my phone at first, so I got another one. Same thing. So I went without some of those apps for awhile, until my job required me to use an app that the Droid 4 could not run because of all the freeze-ups. And because this has been the last smartphone designed with an external keyboard, I had no luck but to go to one of those blasted on-screen keyboards to which it is very frustrating to type on. But such is life. Out with the old, in with the new. She got 5 stars when she was released back in 2012, but how quickly time has passed.","341","Motorola","6"

"5437","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","4","I love the Droid 4. Mainly because of the Qwerty keyboard. This is my 3rd one. Anyway, I can't give this phone a 5, so let's call it 4.75. My only issue with this phone compared to my last is the battery life. I can barely get an hour of talk time. Standby maybe 8 on a good day. My previous Droid 4 could easily get me through the day, and on standby 24 hoiurs not a problem. I don't know if it is the upgraded operating sysem, or just an old battery. The phone was shipped promptly, no issues there. I ordered a high capacity battery, which judging from the reviews should help the power challenge. Regardless I still love this phone, and will regret the day they are no longer available","341","Motorola","6"

The battery issues are not a problem for me as I was still using the original one in my old phone and had to charge it several times a day. It is very fast and has many new features and they fixed a lot of the problems with the older version. I am just pleased that I could find a brand new phone at this late date and the shipper was wonderful. Entire experience is a 5, but now I need to figure out how to use all of those new features as this phone is 2 versions newer than my old one.","341","Motorola","6"

"5450","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","4","I purchased this phone for my wife and got poor reviews at first. Then, after using it a few days, her only complaint was that the battery ran down too quickly and cut short her fun! She loves the larger, tactile QWERTY keyboard and the larger viewing screen the Droid 4 offers. She also loves the ability to see and enjoy pictures received. We just ordered a battery from SavvyCellular and are hoping that this will fix her issue with the phone running down before the end of her 12.5hr shift on a full charge. Still, if you decide to find a Droid 4 to get the larger screen without sacrificing a tactile keyboard for a virtual one, it seems like a good phone to consider. Just know that you will be on Amazon and Ebay trying to find batteries and accesories, since most carriers no longer carry this phone.","341","Motorola","6"

"5459","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","4","I bought this phone to replace my Droid 2 Global. I am mostly satisfied with it. It's much faster, has a nicer larger screen, works reliably, and does virtually everything I hoped for. It also has a real slide-out keyboard, which is overwhelmingly the reason why I bought it. (I hate on-screen keyboards -- they offer no haptic feedback, and consume half of the already-tiny screen space.) Virtually no other smartphones offer real keyboards anymore.There are only a few small shortcomings:- When I slide out the keyboard, I almost inevitably wind up unintentionally pressing one or more keys on the keyboard. This is due to the design of the case, which all but assures that a finger will fall on the keyboard during slideout. The Droid 2 Global had a different case design that didn't result in this problem.- The GPS receiver is much weaker on this phone than on the Droid 2 Global. I can no longer get a GPS signal or use navigation if I have the phone under my car roof. I have to place the phone on the top of the dashboard -- with no metal between phone and sky -- to get a signal. This is awkward. The Droid 2 Global had no problems receiving the GPS signal under my car roof.- Like the Droid 2 Global, the Droid 4 camera suffers from an unpleasant behavior while taking still pictures -- the moment you tap the ""Take photo"" button, the camera defocuses to take a blurry image. (This isn't due to hand trembling; the effect can easily be reproduced with the camera stationary on a table.) The effect is less than with the Droid 2 Global, but it's still there.","341","Motorola","6"
"5460","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","1","WTF! I specifically ordered this Droid and instead got the Droid X delivered. My question is why? I got a better camera from the phone that was delivered but is an outdated model. Now I'm stuck with this crap","341","Motorola","6"
"5461","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","3","When I took this phone to Verizon I specifically asked if this was a new phone as advertised by seller. I was told it was definitely NOT new. Oh well, the price was right; I had it activated. Three months later the phone is ok. It is slow and has occasional glitches, but I love the keyboard.","341","Motorola","6"
"5462","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","2","I love the Droid 4, have had 2 of them. But the vendor listed the one I bought as NEW, and it was not. Was labeled re manufacturedright on the back under the battery cover.","341","Motorola","6"
"5463","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","2","The phone lasted a whopping 3 months. It wouldn't recognize a charger unless you literally held it jammed in there. Freezes, crashes, repeat. Downloading music onto this phone is miserable and it resets all your playlists every time you do. Lousy camera. All around terrible phone. I know its hard to part with a slide out keyboard and there isn't much on the market anymore with one, but I promise you will be happier with a touch screen keyboard than with this phone.","341","Motorola","6"

"5465","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","1","I would give 5 stars because I love the droids with the keyboards, but this is just awful. I can hardly use the phone with out it freezing. If im in an app and get a text message my phone freezes. Im always connected to WiFi yet it seems to drop the signal. At first all was okay if was just a bit laggy, the lag has gotten even worse and turning the phone off and back on does nothing. I've had the phone less than a week and I can no longer use it as a telephone, I cannot hear anything out of it unless I put everyone on speaker phone. This phone should of been brand new.. I am very sceptical about that. Need to try and reach the seller so this can be rectafied sooner rather than later. Didn't spend $140 to throw it away.","341","Motorola","6"

Since this phone has not been made for a while, I should have known that there had to be something seriously wrong with this ""new phone"". It has circuit problems. The sound fades in and out. Even when the speaker feature is on, it will click on and off. It is unusable and a total waste of my time.I keep my phones a long time and take good care of them. I have never dropped it.

"5481","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","1","Built pretty rugged but a very poor performance cell phone. Not at all user friendly with a battery life that lasts less than an hour when the display is being used. Any other smart phone would be much better. The only reason I bought it was to be able to use it over seas due to its global capabilities. But it really is a piece of junk. The features in general really are terrible when you compare it to any of the Samsung, Apple, or even LG phones. Sticking points- you can't delete single texts from a conversation, or resend them when they fail, you have to completely retype the whole message. No calendar, no calculator unless you download app's that eat the battery to death. Overall the phone is just horrible! Avoid this phone!","341","Motorola","6"

Try to find a smartphone today that will let you type in precise search terms like ""Malignant Ascites"" in your search engine. Just try to get either ""OK Google"" or Siri to find such a specific search term. I really want to like this product from Amazon. However, after THIS one went belly up just a few weeks after purchase AND now reading the reviews on the supposedly NEW ones available here. I smell a rat. Way too many folks are complaining about the same weird issues: batteries that won't charge right or charge strangely and intermittently. Song playback issues. Internal Ribbon breakage on the slider. OH, by the way, the battery is easy to replace. Either we all were being lied to, or the glue softens after 2 years. Even after I replaced the battery with a fully charged battery the darn thing discharged very quickly. I strongly suspect tampering with the software by the OEM or Verizon or both. If we could prove it - they should be slapped with a class action law suit. Not that it would matter. I think these evil companies just figure class action law suits is just the cost of doing business.","341","Motorola","6"

I had to let go of my old droid 4 because it was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO slow. And the battery life was terrible. Not on WIFI it lasted 4 hours max. So, I ordered a replacement. It was probably 150% faster, but it was still slow. I'm not sure if I had too many apps installed, I tried having different home screen programs and speed up programs, but none worked. I gave up. The battery life was a lot better. No more QWERTY keyboard. I now have a Moto X Gen 1. It's much faster.-Too slow when I tried to load GPS apps (maps, waze), play games (clash of clans, trivia crack), and even reading emails it would take a couple seconds to pop up.-Battery life was meh. Still had to charge it constantly when in car or at work. Which was insane.I'd imagine the only reason anyone would buy this is for the QWERTY keyboard. Get over it. It's gone. It's not coming back.

Probably could have had it fixed it may have well been a software issue but at this price I bought a new one. I decided to go with the same phone because of the rugged nature of this phone. The screen is gorilla glass which is incredible! I actually ran over this phone with a John Deere tractor and had to pry it out of the mud and another time I actually found my phone inside a large round bale of hay. I lost the phone in one of our fields and found it by calling the phone with my wives cell. The phone continued to work perfectly for two or three years after the incident.

I'm gonna use a physical keyboard phone till they die out which I hope never will be lol. Great for watching free live tv on it and videos and taking pics. Every piece of technology needs a break every now and then so don't get discouraged if your droid 4 starts to act up a bit. The more you use it the more it will get hot and start acting funny.

"5508","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","2","I am amending this review, because I wasn't entirely fair upon memory recollection. The phone was fairly heavily used, but did in fact turn on, but would not hold a charge for more than a few minutes or so. I opened the case and noticed the crazy battery they put in these things was broken on the attachments so I ordered a new battery and back cover. The extra drawback was that once I installed these I have never been able to get the phone to turn back on again so it may be in my error. I should give props to the sender because I started a return but do to my crazy work schedule a bit of time passed so I didn't think that to be fair to them and just kept the phone. Thank you to the seller for offering to allow me to return it, but overall I think the phone was way to heavy and bulky, almost clumsy like to want to own. I would not buy this model again and plan to sell mine for scrap.","341","Motorola","6"

"5519","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","4","I purchased this phone for my wife and got poor reviews at first. Then, after using it a few days, her only complaint was that the battery ran down too quickly and cut short her fun! She loves the larger, tactile QWERTY keyboard and the larger viewing screen the Droid 4 offers. She also loves the ability to see and enjoy pictures received. We just ordered a battery from SavvyCellular and are hoping that this will fix her issue with the phone running down before the end of her 12.5hr shift on a full charge. Still, if you decide to find a Droid 4 to get the larger screen without sacrificing a tactile keyboard for a virtual one, it seems like a good phone to consider. Just know that you will be on Amazon and Ebay trying to find batteries and accesories, since most carriers no longer carry this phone.","341","Motorola","6"

"5524","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","4","[Review updated twice to reflect multiple orders]ORIGINAL REVIEW: When my Droid 2 died I wanted to replace it with a Droid 4 with the great keyboard. But the Droid 4 I received would not turn on after trying to charge it, and troubleshooting steps did not help. According to the IMEI (serial number), the phone's warranty expired May 2013, so the phone was not new but was refurbished. It was in a Droid 4 box that didn't contain a tool for removing the battery cover or any user guide. I've returned the phone (to G Wholesale LLC).UPDATE 1: I rolled the dice and ordered another ""new"" Droid 4 from the same vendor. The second Droid 4 also was defective. It would not start charging or power on. Also, when I pulled out the sliding keyboard, a tiny ball bearing fell out! Motorola support again said the IMEI showed the phone was out of warranty (expired Sept. 2013). I returned that one too.UPDATE 2: I finally succeeded with my third order. This one was listed as refurbished and sold by Cheapa4u at HALF the price of the ""new"" ones that were used and defective (fifty-three instead of one-hundred-ten dollars). It appeared to be in excellent condition, and the sticker on the battery showed a Sept. 2013 manufacture date. The phone is working well in every way and is a BIG improvement over my old Droid 2 that died.I'm aware that the phone has a reputation for short battery life and difficulty finding good replacement batteries, so I'm using as many battery-saving methods as possible, including Llama (location-aware mobile app) and Motorola's SmartActions. By minimizing power use and relying on my office PC during most of the work day, the battery only drops to about 70% by the end of each day.I had a lot of trouble activating the Droid 4 with PagePlus Cellular, even though I had the required PagePlus 4G LTE micro SIM card. Failed multiple tries to activate with PagePlus phone support. Had to find a PagePlus dealer and drive 20 miles to his office so he could activate my SIM card in a different Verizon network phone and then install it in mine. Whew!All in all, it was a lot of trouble to snag the last Motorola smartphone with a great physical keyboard. I'm now eyeing the supercool but pricey Blackberry Priv as a possible next phone once this one quits.","341","Motorola","6"

"5526","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","1","The phone can't keep up with the demands of today's apps. It might work solely as a phone until the charger port stops working. Then, since the battery is not removable, once that happens, the phone is dead. Save up... get an iPhone","341","Motorola","6"
"5527","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","2","I actually love the Droid 4 because of the slide out keyboard but this particular refurbished one that I got from this seller in January (but finally put into action and activated it the other day) has a tinny vibrating metal noise that echos with every word on phone calls. I'm obviously disappointed. It's slightly slow and freezes briefly at times, like my other one did (though not as bad) but otherwise works ""okay."" Good thing I don't make too many phone calls if I can help it, but it is annoying when I need to use the phone for talking.I wish they had taken the time to test the phone call aspect of it before deeming it fit to sell to people. Obviously, that was not the case. Had I activated it back when I got it, I'd be able to return it, but since I waited until I really needed to before switching phones, I can't do that. However, the seller (Motorola!) should have tested it before selling it to make sure it worked properly all around and they did not. Or if they did, they did a lousy job of making sure it was up to par. So I am giving it 2 stars for that reason. New Droid 4's probably work fine. I would not buy refurbished phones again unless I just needed one as a back up.","341","Motorola","6"

"5532","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","5","First off let me say the I luv the Droid numeric (physical Keyboard) series of phones. Prior to the Droid 4 I had a Droid 3, and over time, malfunctions began to occur. I really was waiting for a Droid 5, but it became apparent to me that that's not going to happen. I hate virtual keyboards, and require a physical keyboard. I guess I'm in the minority because it's impossible to find a phone with a keyboard, unless it's a Blackberry, and I don't want one of those.The Droid 4 will run a modern, not the latest, version of Android, Jelly Bean. I'm an Apple guy, and I would have loved an iPhone, but you know why that's just not possible.My purchasing experience however has been horrible. Since early November of '14, I have bought THREE (3) Droid 4s. All have been sold as NEW, and none of them were. The first was bought from Misty Electronics, an eBay and Amazon seller. This was the worst experience of the three. I bought through their store front hoping to save a little money on my ""NEW"" phone. The phone was in a generic box, had a third party charger and did not have the required Droid Data Cable. Battery Life was also terrible. Activation at Verizon was a nightmare, the Verizon clerk really screwed up the experience. I stayed up until 2AM straightening out the mess he created with my phone. Once straightened out and activated, the phone never really was right, it would sometimes jitter and would require restarts. Since I spent so much time on the activation, I tried to make it work, but after five weeks, the phone up and died. I contacted Misty Electronics and got no response. I then went through PayPal, and since it was just over 45 days, they were of no help. I finally contacted him directly and got some nasty replies. He stated he had a 30 day warranty and his last message to me contained the following:""In any case, lets not email each other any longer. I will not respond. I ask you please to not message me back.""Now that's customer service for you!!!!!! I am stuck with this worthless piece of junk!I bought the second phone from Amazon Seller, Vmerica Trading. This Droid 4, also sold as new. It came in a crushed box with a third party charger and again, no data cable. I appeared unblemished, but the touch screen would not function when the keyboard was extended. Since I bought through Amazon, I was able to return it for full credit.I bought the third phone from Amazon Seller, Buytacular Bargains, LLC. This Droid 4 was also sold as new. It came in a soiled Droid Razr Maxx Box with a third party charger, but it did include the Motorola Data Cable. It appeared clean, but when opened it was stamped Remanufactured. So again, not an as advertised NEW phone. I contacted Amazon, and they issued me a 20% credit.This phone is working as it should and I luv it. It's a GREAT phone, IMHO, and I wish Motorola had not stopped it's physical keyboard series of phones.My advice here, if it says NEW, don't believe it.","341","Motorola","6"

Most apps would routinely fail to respond and would need to be closed. The phone essentially became unusable for making calls or anything else.

"5540","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","5","Customer from Singapore, ordered this from Wireless Hub @ $133.95 on 26-Oct-2014, took about a week to be delivered to the destination gateway. So far it's been 1 week old and I am absolutely satisfied so far. Here are some reviews and Q&A people might wanna know, here they are:- Yes I received a genuine XT894 box set (a lil rusty in the hdmi, since it was manufactured in 2012?)- Yes it looks new to me, refurbished or not, I don't know and can't tell anyway, I don't care anyway- Yes it is an unlocked phone, if I can use it with a SG microSIM so can you (free from contract)- Yes it comes with a USB charger, backdoor detached, photocopied manual, that's all, no Verizon SIMcard- Yes it works on 3G, at least in SG. For LTE - check out GSMarena for your country freq bands- Yes it needs some tweak, google for ""cdma to gsm patch"" for GSM-only country, so that your call/SMS/3G/4G works- Yes it ships in Android 4.1.2 default, but I flashed CyanogenMod-11 on it to get KitKat 4.4, no bloatware, very fast- Yes it can be rooted, all you need is to google how to root a Droid 4 :)- Yes it works with a 64GB microSD SDXC card, just slot it in and format it using the phone- Yes it does have 3rd party upsize battery which you can buy from Mugen, last 2.1x longer than stock battery- Yes it fits the Trident Aegis case very well (unless you change to a Mugen battery)- Yes it fits the Empire screen protector perfectly- Yes by comparing to newer 2014 phones, it is not as good, but it is still the best QWERTY till date- Yes by doing all of the above you lose warranty, though it is unlikely you are getting any for a 2012 phoneHope it helps!

"5544","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","5","Purchased as a backup to my present MD4. I love this phone because of the physical QWERTY board. Yep, I'm a texter! Similar to a former LG Ally I was used to, but way more feature packed. The only thing I could do without are the pre-programmed apps in the unit and the battery life could be a bit longer, but lasts roughly a couple days for my use, which is great for me! Of a sturdy construction, and fits practically in a medium sized hand. Compact enough to slip in my pocket, large enough to view screen items, and responsive enough to access all the modern conveniences of our technological society. Good sound quality and works good with a bluetooth. A good range of ringtones, but limited alarm tones vs. my former Ally. If you are looking to watch movies and seek game playing quality, I would suggest a laptop or Kindle type device. But remember...IT'S A PHONE FIRST!

"5575","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","5","The Droid 4 is definitely one of my favourites if not the best phone I've ever owned. The obvious selling point for this phone is the full slide-out keyboard which is great for people like myself that have slightly larger or more clumsy fingers and enjoy the tactile feedback of a physical keyboard while at the same time freeing up more screen real estate for whatever it is you are doing instead of blocking out half the screen with a touch-keyboard.Other than that, it does everything a modern cell phone should do and does it as fast as anyone could need between the 4G connectivity and plenty of processing power and storage space. It's also rather convenient, at least on the Verizon version of the phone that it has a SIM card slot so you can very easily swap out your attached number or account just by opening up the back of the phone. Sufficiently durable and definitely for people who don't want a brick but do want their phone to have at least a bit of mass to it.Honestly I haven't seen any more recent phones that can even satisfactorily replace this phone as it seems all the major phone makers are doing away with physical keyboards and only offering sub-par options that are not really much better than the Droid 4 in specs. This is why I've replaced my original droid 4 with yet another droid 4 after my first one had a few years of wear on it. Saved a bunch of money not ""upgrading"" to a new model and I still love all the features that this one offers.","341","Motorola","6"

All are available and work well!Battery life was an initial concern but as I got my settings zeroed in, that has become less of an issue.

"5617","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","2","Let me preface this by saying this is not the first time I've owned this phone. I bought this one to replace my old DROID 4 that was just worn out. I loved it and thought I would get the same service out of this one. The unique qualities of this phone include the military grade toughness that you can't get with an iphone or anything else. I have difficulty with all touch screens, so the slide-out keypad is perfect.However, I'm experiencing the same freezing problem with most of the apps, despite the version of app or OS I use. Does it work? Yes. Does it work well? No.Unfortunately, I think there's just something embedded into the software that keeps phones from lasting longer than two years so we have to buy the new stuff from the phone companies. Oh, and the battery life isn't much better either. With a full charge, I get maybe 15 minutes of gps service and not much better with most social media apps. It's just not worth it to get another one of these remarkable creatures. Oh, and that slider function? Freezes the homescreen 8 out of 10 times. That's not an estimate. I actually collected the data over 100 uses and that's the result.Bottom line: You'll not find anything that performs the way this phone did when it first came out. Not even the same model you buy today.","341","Motorola","6"

Apparently, when a big wave hits your son, and he gets washed out to sea, charging into the saltwater to get your son voids the warranty on a droid 2. Anyway.The slide out keyboard is convenient, and the battery (which is screwed in and ""technically"" not user-replaceable) holds a charge all day, with data and wifi turned on.

"5640","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","4","I bought this phone because I had it back in 2012( but it fell while charging and the charging port broke. So, Verizon gave me the Samsung Galaxy Stratosphere II since I was determined to still have a physical QWERTY keyboard phone and they didn't have the Droid 4 in stock . But after a while, the Stratosphere II just played out on me due to normal wear and tear. Began to overheat and freeze a lot. Started doing factory resets every 2-3 months. Got frustrated with how often I had to do it.So, finally, I had enough of that and bought another Droid 4.So far so good. First thing first though if you buy this, check for an OS update. I know some apps that we use now do not support older OS.One thing I enjoy so far that some may not care about is now I can post videos on Instagram. I could not do that on the Stratasphere II.Pros: -Physical QWERTY keyboard with a tab button(comes in handy when you work on as many documents as I do on the go and can not always get to a computer) -The latest OS makes this device greater than what it was when I had it in 2012(which of course I know is what it is supposed to do, but sometimes OS updates suck *cough cough* Windows Vista *cough cough*Cons: -Fragile Charging port -Like with all smartphones I wish the battery lasted a bit longer.

"5646","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","3","I have had two of these in the 2014-2015 time period. One is still my primary phone. Today's apps are getting a little large for this older model phone. At times it is necessary to manually kill off browser and facebook tasks to free-up memory. I've stuck with this model so far because I love the slide-out QWERTY keyboard.As far as the amazon purchase goes, everything was almost as expected. My one complaint was that the condition was labeled New on the site, but the tiny screen covering the front speaker was dented and that speaker was a little raspy sounding. There were wear marks where the keyboard slides out as well. It was obviously refurbished rather than being in perfectly New condition. Other than the speaker and the (minor) slider wear, the rest of the phone looked as if it were factory new. Screen, Keyboard, Rear pannel all had absolutely no signs of wear.","341","Motorola","6"

"5649","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","2","I've only had two smart phones in my life, the Droid and Droid 4. I only upgraded to the Droid 4 a few months ago after deciding I wanted something with a better camera and better battery life but that still had the slide-out keyboard. Even though the Droid 4 supposedly has a larger capacity battery, the life is not as good, even after making sure all unnecessary apps were off, which is something I never bothered to check on the older Droid. At first I thought that maybe the battery wasn't good since I had bought a refurbished phone so I bought a brand new battery and replaced it. Battery life did not improve.Another thing I don't like about is that the turn-by-turn navigation app requires you to pay a fee, so I have never used it. It will give you written directions to the location, but it won't guide you through them as you drive. It also has google maps for free but the old droid had a free turn-by-turn navigation app that worked OK and was a feature I used and still use often, so I'm trying third-party apps.I do prefer the 5-row keyboard of the Droid 4 to the Droid, and the front-facing camera is a nice feature. It doesn't seem to have as many software issues as the older model, but I still encounter app and browser crashes on a semi-regular basis. There is also a ton of apps pre-installed on the phone that cannot be removed, making finding the apps you do want difficult at times if you don't have shortcuts on the home screen. But there is a lot of room on the home screen for shortcuts so it's not a huge issue. I just really dislike the idea of being forced to keep stuff on my phone I don't want.If you're familiar with the Android OS then transitioning to this phone won't be much of an issue. You can pretty much jump right into using it without too much issue.I would say that the Droid 4 isn't a bad phone, but compared to the first droid, it's not enough of an improvement to warrant switching to it from an older Droid.","341","Motorola","6"

"5651","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","4","I purchase this cell phone for my husband. Why? Because he has killed so many cell phones as of late that our cell phones insurance will no longer insure any phone on his line. Looking over all the cell phones he has loved and some how destroyed I noticed he specially liked the Droid 4. It had good battery life for the super user he is, it had a full keyboard that he likes, and it serves at a hot spot wonderfully for other devices without getting overly hot. I gave this cell phone 4 stars because this is not a newer phone and people I think need to be aware of that if they don't know it already. While it isn't the newest model out, that doesn't mean it isn't a great work horse of a cell phone.

"5662","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","2","When they first came out, the Droid-4 was exactly what I and many others needed with a slide out keyboard. It was perfect for those of us who can't stand typing on screens. But sadly, as apps continue to be developed this phone and operating system gets more and more obsolete, not able to run many of the modern day apps anymore. Facebook and facebook messenger, for starters. Frequent freeze-ups on the apps, or phone goes unresponsive. I thought it was just my phone at first, so I got another one. Same thing. So I went without some of those apps for awhile, until my job required me to use an app that the Droid 4 could not run because of all the freeze-ups. And because this has been the last smartphone designed with an external keyboard, I had no luck but to go to one of those blasted on-screen keyboards to which it is very frustrating to type on. But such is life. Out with the old, in with the new. She got 5 stars when she was released back in 2012, but how quickly time has passed.","341","Motorola","6"

Anyway, I can't give this phone a 5, so let's call it 4.75. My only issue with this phone compared to my last is the battery life. I can barely get an hour of talk time. Standby maybe 8 on a good day. My previous Droid 4 could easily get me through the day, and on standby 24 hoiurs not a problem. I don't know if it is the upgraded operating sysem, or just an old battery. The phone was shipped promptly, no issues there. I ordered a high capacity battery, which judging from the reviews should help the power challenge. Regardless I still love this phone, and will regret the day they are no longer available","341","Motorola","6"
"5667","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","5","Still the best phone with a physical keyboard.

"5673","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","2","It took 1 day for the phone to charge.Then it would not hold a charge for 24 hrs","341","Motorola","6"
"5674","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","4","This phone would me 5 stars if it were 2012 and maybe 2013 but now in 2015 yikes. I owned the droid bionic, I own the droid ultra and the droid 4 which do I choose as my cell well the droid 4 and here is why , but wait the droid ultra is newer and has to be better in all ways. Yes it is but it sadly became a gaming device I play games on it more than I text and call so when I do want to text and call the battery is dead and I have to wait to charge it and sometimes that can get in the way when you really need to reach someone but anyways, the droid 4 has a qwerty keyboard and its the last droid to have it droid 5 never came out and as a major texter this just blew me away I love it and it feels retro I would say. Droid 4 is a great cell phone but not so much a smart phone here is why it can connect to the 4g lte from verizon but it was a 3g phone so when you turn on your data you droid 4 will lose battery fast like nose dive fast it may only last 6-7 hours and that is with just having it on if your actually using it for youtube or something it will drain faster 4-5 hours maybe less so if you just need to check emails or something quick it will do fine. If you don't turn on the data on it will last 3 days and if you text like 200 messages a day then day and a half of life which is like WHAT ? So for me the droid 4 has better battery life because I turn the data on only when need it so this phone is not for gaming or viewing hulu and such its for calls and text you know what cell phones use to do. Everything else is ok its an old phone but it works quite well like you can use chromecast and hangouts and google drive etc but not everything is ok it shows its age. Its bluetooth seems non existant it can't find my droid ultra it can connect to my chromebook not even with motorola connect my bluetooth speaker won't interact with it my sony smartwatch 2 won't connect to it. I got it and it said it was new and well it was not nothing serious just cosmetic I paid 103 so I think that seems fair saw it for 109 right now so 100 range for a used phone. Now then I have drop it twice now once on the stone floor at work it survived phew and again in the parking lot of the apartmemts where I live survived but there was slight damage thank god that its made of some kind of metal. The biggest scare was wait....ok back story im with verizon and my droid ultra use a nano sim the droid 4 uses a micro sim so it won't fit but with the verizon pre paid package of $45 a month you get sim adapters for the nano sim so put the nano in the micro and tada you can use the older phone. The scare was that I was switching them in and out from the phone every couple of days so days I worked it was in the droid ultra days off it was in the droid 4 so I could play games and stuff on the droid ultra then one those time the sim adapter got stuck inside the droid 4 and I could not get it out the nano sim did get out and I had to destroy the sim adapter with a utility knife that I had pull out a piece and cut it out and repeat then slid a thin piece of paper to see that I got it all out and hoping I did not break my droid 4 bought a new sim adapter MediaDevil Simdevil 3-in-1 SIM Card Adapter Kit (Nano / Micro / Standard) and use it and I could use the droid 4 again and im not gonna switch back and one last thing it has expandable memory so music and photos no prob and the droid ultra does not heck not even the droid turbo or the moto x has that which is a big bummer. I use it for music but its not very loud and will drain the battery so I use the cable that came with the bluetooth speaker and no more worries. Get it now before the price keeps going up if you just want a cell phone with a keyboard and I heard that you can use it with page plus which I have never heard from befrore.","341","Motorola","6"

"5694","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","4","overall great phone. had a droid 2 global prior to the droid 4. the droid 4 is very comparable and performs better than the droid 2 global by quite a lot. much faster processing, better internet connectivity, able to play much more internet videos than the droid 2 global, larger screen is nice, love the slider keyboard minus a few alternate keys such as: !, @, which are not user friendly keys when fast typing, and another downer is that the droid 4 lacks the alt lock feature that the droid 2 global has. if motorola would have kept the alt lock feature for the droid 4 keyboard and kept a few keys as primary keys instead of secondary keys which have to be accesed via alt, than this phone would be much better for typing. the other stupid thing motorola did with the droid 4 is made the battery non removable, wtf?! seriously stupid, but the battery life on the droid 4 is better than th droid 2 global, not a whole lot, but by enough to where it is very noticeable, and makes me think that since it only has a little more milli amp hours to it, I think the main difference is the droid 4 is more power efficient than the droid 2 global was.although motorola should have put a much larger battery like the droid maxx has (3500 mah). one othr thing that sucks on the droid 4 compared to the droid 2 global is the flimsy battery cover, at least the droid 2's battery cover is solid sturdy metal with very solid engagement, unlike the flimsy crap plastic cover on the droid 4. another stupid thing motorola did on the droid 4 is the power port location is towards the bottom of the phone on the same side the droid 2's is on, which makes it really difficult to charge while driving since the phone has to sit upside down in the cup holder for the power cord to connect, at least on the droid 2 the charge port was in a much better spot being towards the top of the phone. another downer is that motorola didn't use the corning gorilla glass for the screen on the droid 4 which many of the newer phones now have.motorola also should have made the droid slider phones bodies of aluminum or stainless steel to make them really durable, if you have a slider you know it's gonna be heavier anyways so it may as well be for a good reason, kinda like a chevelle: bad gas mileage for a good reason, lots of horsepower.","341","Motorola","6"

"5708","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","4","I bought this phone to replace my Droid 2 Global. I am mostly satisfied with it. It's much faster, has a nicer larger screen, works reliably, and does virtually everything I hoped for. It also has a real slide-out keyboard, which is overwhelmingly the reason why I bought it. (I hate on-screen keyboards -- they offer no haptic feedback, and consume half of the already-tiny screen space.) Virtually no other smartphones offer real keyboards anymore.There are only a few small shortcomings:- When I slide out the keyboard, I almost inevitably wind up unintentionally pressing one or more keys on the keyboard. This is due to the design of the case, which all but assures that a finger will fall on the keyboard during slideout. The Droid 2 Global had a different case design that didn't result in this problem.- The GPS receiver is much weaker on this phone than on the Droid 2 Global. I can no longer get a GPS signal or use navigation if I have the phone under my car roof. I have to place the phone on the top of the dashboard -- with no metal between phone and sky -- to get a signal. This is awkward. The Droid 2 Global had no problems receiving the GPS signal under my car roof.- Like the Droid 2 Global, the Droid 4 camera suffers from an unpleasant behavior while taking still pictures -- the moment you tap the ""Take photo"" button, the camera defocuses to take a blurry image. (This isn't due to hand trembling; the effect can easily be reproduced with the camera stationary on a table.) The effect is less than with the Droid 2 Global, but it's still there.","341","Motorola","6"
"5709","Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless","224","4","Before this i had the Droid 2. The keyboard on the Droid 4 is far better. The row for number keys are and the feel while typing made it so. I mainly use it for data and rarely for SMS and voice. With this its perfect. One thing I find unpleasant is the slowness in changing from portrait to landscape. There is a delay compared to an experience on the iphone.","341","Motorola","6"

It took nearly an hour but it makes a huge difference! The biggest problem solved is the overly sensitive touch settings.Many of the things like contact transfer, internet sharing, additional settings are added or corrected.The only thing that this phone lacks is the front facing camera which I didn't need, since I don't do video calling. I setup my Skype to use a static picture.Do your research and make sure that this is the phone that fits your needs. I chose it over the 900 because I wanted the smaller size and curved screen. Using it for business is very nice!! The voice commands aren't as sophisticated as Siri, but still works great for my needs. Adjusted the camera settings and pictures come out much better than online reviews.Oh, if you're trying to put a custom ringtone - Music clip must be less than 1 MB and less than 40 seconds. In Zune, you must right-click on the song, change genre to Ringtone/Ring Tone in the ""Collections"" > ""Music"" tab. You must also go into ""Settings"" > ""Phone"" > ""Conversion Settings"". Change Audio setting to ""Only convert media files that aren't supported by the device"" (This will allow songs you upload to appear under a ""Custom"" group on your phone.","156","Nokia","7"

The performance of the touch screen is really good. I was a bit afraid that windows phones would have much less apps, but all the apps I knew from Iphone or Android phones that wanted I was able to find. Compared to Lumia 900, the screen is a bit smaller but for me that was a plus, because too big phones are uncomfortable to carry (at least to me, considering that I always like to have my phone in my pocket), plus, the 900 unlocked was $300 more expensive. The battery life us very good. I usually charge it while I am sleeping, get-up at 7-8 am and do not need to re-charge it during the day. When I go to sleep, about 12 am, the phone still has some battery charge so I'd say for me it's been lasting more than 14-16h. The colors, the quality of the graphics are outstanding. The only thing that would make this phone even better is a front camera to be able to skype and a better camera for taking pictures. The pictures are not bad, actually, but they are clearly less quality than old my sony dsc 6 megapixels, which I bought in 2005. One of the features I like the most from this phone (shared with other nokia smartphones) is the stand alone GPS. It's like having a GPS included in the phone without the need of data usage. I also have a GPS in my car and I made them work together and I'd say the phone is actually better than the GPS. It is very useful to be able to download the maps for different cities, countries, etc for free. I can use the phone while walking in a city I have never been in before and have my nokia lumia tell me exactly how to get where I want through my earphones. So convenient!I think this is a highly recommendable cell phone!","156","Nokia","7"

It is a T-Mobile Germany version of the device, unlocked though. I didn't get any recipt or proof of purchaseOverall, the Lumia 800 is an awesome device. The display is beautiful, all features work properly.The only problem is the in-call volume. I tried it several times, in several locations and there is lack of clarity and audio volume.I can only hear the other person clearly if I align the earpiece directly in my ear. The volume is at maximum but still it is too low. Moreover, in noisy environments it becomes completely inaudible.I am surprised no one else mentioned it before. It could be a problem with just my device but I doubt it.I am probably going to return it.","156","Nokia","7"
"5789","Nokia Lumia 800 Unlocked GSM Phone with Windows 7.5 OS, 3.7"" AMOLED Multi-Touchscreen, 8MP Camera with Carl Zeiss Optics, Video, GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and FM Radio - Black","99.95","4","Nokia has always had great design language and Lumia 800 speaks it. Holding the phone just feels so natural, very well made. The finish doesn't look cheap at all. I love the curved glass on the front, it makes swiping very comfortable and the display just melts into the phone. I think this was Nokia's last phone that deserves a place in Industrial Design museum. Overall I put this phone just below Google's Nexus and below (by far) iPhone.What I loved:-great design-battery life is pretty good-great display-modern Windows Phone 7.5 OS-usability and ease of use-internet share-connectivity with social networks-Microsoft Office apps-Exchange and Outlook support-touch-typing-all apps look consistent, unlike Android.-Nokia mapsWhat made me return the phone:-Windows Phone has no apps-some apps are just a good try but not what I expect from a smartphone (looking at you, Yelp)-Internet Explorer 9 is not what you expect in 2012, maybe 2005. Most websites render for feature phones, very limited.-multitasking is confusing-Bluetooth car stereo support is almost to none (most phones I had show singer and song when playing, this phone does not)-processing speed and memory is a bit off, when listening to online radio and browsing the web, the radio breaks up and stops, almost like the phone can't handle the streaming-syncing phone with MAC and PC is a complete JOKE. Couldn't sync with iTunes on MAC. Tried syncing with PC, worked first time, then gave errors.Again, this phone feels more like it's from previous generation and probably will be great for most people. Microsoft has a lot of catching up, and Nokia just waking up. I just hope it's not too late for both.","156","Nokia","7"

This phone is my favorite phone by a landslide. The fit and finish of this phone is second to none. My only regret is waiting this long to make the move.When it comes to social media, communication (texting, instant messaging), taking pictures, the Windows Phone is just so much faster and easier than any of the other phones I have owned. It's really like the normal things people do on a phone has just been thought out better and it requires fewer clicks.Socia media - Facebook, Live, LinkedIn and Twitter all all integrated. You can see all of your updates, or respond to your friends from one location, the People hub. It also shows all of your friends pictures from all of the different social media apps in the single location. No need to launch each app to see what's happening. Awesome!Communication - Threaded communication means that your Facebook or Live instant messages and texting is all in the same place. When you go to text someone, you can instantly see if they are online with one of the other apps and you can chat where they are...of if they are offline, go ahead and text. Again, no need to launch the different apps to get in touch with friends.Zune software is incredible. I now pay $9.99 per month for a subscription and I can download as much music as I want...so can my wife and so can my kids...or we can stream music to the PC's, Mac, or Xbox....all for $9.99. On the phone, hear a song you like, click on the search button and then click on the music button...it identifies the song and you can simply download it right there. My personal favorite is going into artists I like and swiping to see similar or related artists and downloading other music I wouldn't have considered.Taking pictures with this phone is great. As soon as I got the phone, there was an update so I am not sure if the update improved the camera, but based on some other comments, I would have to assume that is the case. Regardless, the dedicated camera button means that I can take the locked phone out of my pocket and I can push the button which automatically turns the phone on, unlocks it and goes into the camera for snapping a picture. You can have it set to automatically upload to Skydrive or Facebook, or you can simply click to post...I heard someone describe it as ""pocket, to picture, to post""...it really is nice.Apps: The apps are great. I downloaded every app that I have on my iPad and on my Kindle fire. The only app I am missing was audible. Otherwise, the apps that I had on my other devices are also available on the Windows Phone. For games, it's also pretty cool that the Xbox integration displays all of my info including my Avatar. Not a big deal for me, but it's kind of fun.On Tmobile, I can only get 2G or Edge network. I know that there will be times where that will probably matter, but I find that 70% of the time, my phone is connected to wifi instead of cell when I am in a place where I might be searching for stuff. On the other hand, the Nokia GPS downloads the maps, so cell connection for GPS isn't necessary. Most of the apps download stuff in the background, so compared to my previous tmobile 4G phone, I can honestly say, I haven't noticed any difference. I will probably have to try some side by side cell tests to see the difference. . .bottom line, if you are in a place to have a cell signal, it works fine. If you don't have good reception (you wouldn't have a faster network connection anyway), so it's no different. Driving down the road, I hold the Windows button for voice commands and I ask for an address. It finds the address quickly and then provides the turn-by-turn...if that works quickly, then everything else is pretty easy.Only negative...no forward facing camera. However, again, after having the iPhone and an Android phone that had one...I can say that it's really more of a gimmick for me. At the end of the day, if I am going to be sitting in a place to do a video call, I wouldn't be doing it on my phone. Still, I think it was a dumb move not to include the FF camera.After seeing my phone, my wife just ditched her Android phone and went to Tmobile today...she bought the Lumia 710 (4G).Well done Nokia!","156","Nokia","7"

I current carry an unlocked iPhone 4 on T-Mobile and a Galaxy S2 on Verizon. The Galaxy is clearly the fastest and spec rich phone of the three but feels cheap and I find android in general lacks the fluid UI of the iPhone. To my huge surprise I actually liked Win 7.5 more than iOS, I hated the old Windows phone OS's and expect more of the same. The newer version or Windows Phone is simply a new beast. Microsoft took all the best aspects of iPhone's simplicity and went one better with live tiles and great office integration. Its easy to use and very intuitive and the Lumia 800 just feel perfect in your hand. If you use Microsoft Office this phone is wonderful.Cons:My iPhone 4 works pretty well on EDGE data, and locking to EDGE I get two days of battery life and I very rarely find myself wishing I was on 3G. I found the Windows 7.5 on the Lumia seemed to have a bit of a harder time on EDGE. It also seemed to lack the insanely good signal lock I have come to expect from Nokia phones. The Nokia/MS mapping apps don't get by as easily on EDGE as the iPhone. I would not say it's a big problem, but I did find myself tethering to my Galaxy whenever I could.The other thing I did like is that this isn't a carrier unlocked device, the unit I received was software branded for Vodaphone Germany and had been opened and unlocked via an unlock code. I actually wanted an unbranded phone. I would have preferred to see this listed in the description and I would probably not have bought a branded phone as it has all the Vodaphone app links.Overall:A beautiful phone and a magnificent OS, Microsoft and Nokia are on to a winner here. I would probably say skip this phone unless you can get 3G.","156","Nokia","7"
"5797","Nokia Lumia 800 Unlocked GSM Phone with Windows 7.5 OS, 3.7"" AMOLED Multi-Touchscreen, 8MP Camera with Carl Zeiss Optics, Video, GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and FM Radio - Black","99.95","5","First off, I do a terrible job of reviewing, so go to mobiletechreview.com and search for this phone there if you want a better one with a video. Here are just some things from my experience. As far as the device and the hardware are concerned this is a fantastic phone. The build is very solid. The skin that's packaged with the phone is very good quality and changes almost nothing about its appearance. I don't like having to use a skin or a case though, and this phone is nice for people like me as well, because the body is rugged enough to survive without one. For this price I think a phone should be durable and attractive looking, and this phone is both. The UI might take a little getting used to; I came from an android phone and it took me a day or so to be completely familiar with this, but really it isn't difficult. The phone is very fast where it can be, and what I mean is some apps like internet explorer 9 are just not very fast right now, so the phone cooks as long as the apps allow it to. Generally nothing is slow with this thing except ie9 and the windows facebook app, which really needs work. The hardware speaker is loud but not what you want to listen to music or other media from. You won't miss a call from lack of volume, but get some headphones if music is important to you because you won't want to hear it from the speaker. I have tmobile in the US, so I can't speak for at&t users here, but this definitely only works on edge on tmobile's network. There is wifi literally everywhere I go, so I haven't had a data plan in years, but if you're one of those people who ""needs"" 3G or better, wait at least until the lumia 900 comes out and see if you can find an unlocked device then. If you do get this one then go to the marketplace and download the nokia app 'network setup'. You'll need to run this to get MMS working on tmobile at least, maybe on at&t also. After you do this the phone is truly unlocked, except for the 3G thing of course. If you are into the android mindset of being able to modify your phone software, and make all your icons and homescreen look different 5 times a day, then you won't like WP7 for the same reason you don't like ios. Now that's fine, but if you are like me and you just want a simple interface that's fast and responsive (and so far has given me no force closes) then WP7 is right up your alley, and on this device it's fantastic. If 3G and 4G are deal breakers for you, then the lumia 710 might be worth looking at since it's tmobile branded and guaranteed to work state side.***My lumia 800 was imported from Germany, so it started up in German and that is also the language of all the printed material in the box. It came with a piece of paper from the seller stating, in English, what options to chose on initial startup to get the phone in English. It's completely painless, and after that it's totally in English, but there are 2 or 3 applications that you'll end up uninstalling because they were loaded for consumers in Germany. These apps don't seem to be of any use in the states. Just be aware that if you buy this import it could quit literally be from anywhere that its sold in Europe, and so also be in that country's language when you first turn it on.EDIT: I forgot to mention battery life. I've been using the heck out of this phone since I got it a few days ago. I can't say for sure how long it lasts on a charge, but it will definitely go an entire work day under heavy (wifi internet) use before you have to think about how much life it has left. Most places I look users say to give it a week to settle in, and apparently the firmware update gives an inaccurate battery life reading for the first few days. For example, my phone right now says it has 62% battery remaining and that it will last another 20hrs on that charge, with 12 hrs since my last charge. I don't know if it will make it 32hrs off one charge, but I can say that it definitely makes it through the day without giving any low battery warnings. In fact, I'll edit this review when the phone dies and report on how long it actually lasted.","156","Nokia","7"

I decided to give windows phone a try. I am so glad that I did. It was between the Lumia 800 or 710. The 800 has such great build quality.Hardware: It comes with only 16gb of memory. No expansion slot of any kind. With WP7, you get 25gb of free storage on Microsofts SkyDrive. The 1.5gHz processor is extremely fast and never has a problem with loading or scrolling through the OS. The Amoled screen is crisp, clear and bright. Its only a 800x480 but that is standard on all the WP7 phones. 8mp camera with a Carl Zeiss lens and twin LED flashes.Fit and Finish: The phone feels amazing in my hands. The one piece shell fits perfectly in my hand and it just feels so good. No gaps between the gorilla glass and the body. Nokia also includes a molded silicon/rubber case with the phone. It fits perfect so you never need to actually buy a case for it. It took me a while to get use to the button placement but I got the hang of it in a day or so.Screen: The Amoled screen is bright and vibrant. I never knew what I was missing until I saw this thing. The colors are so crisp. The curved glass makes it very easy to swipe left or right.Windows Phone: This is my first windows phone, mine came with mango (7.5). Its super smooth and slick. It never hangs up or has forced closes. The phone is only a single core processor but you would never be able to tell. Its the perfect balance between android and iOS. Its also really easy to use.Apps: Nokia includes a few nice apps. Its definitely not bloatware. Nokia Drive is a gps app that downloads all the maps for a country or region onto your phone. It gives turn by turn directions and you can use it offline since the information is stored on your phone. Nokia maps is a neat app that is similar to a google maps but with a lot more features. You can view the map in 3d, it shows traffic updates, and it gives you public transit routes with stops. It helped me navigate Portland, OR without a problem. You can also set it up to show you reviews and close by restaurants. Nokia Music is very similar to pandora and you can purchase the music from the zune store when you like a certain song.The windows market place has plenty of apps. If I can't find the exact app that is in the iOS/Android Market app store, I can easily find an app that can replace it. Also, WP7 has amazing voice features, which I didn't know about when I bought the phone (way better than Siri on my friends 4S). It also comes with a full version of Microsoft Office that can be linked to their cloud services (Office 365, Sky Drive, Office Live, etc.)Camera: The camera is bit of a downer. Its an 8mp with dual LED flashes. There are so many settings its hard to a shot just right. I takes clear, focused pictures every time but there are so many filters to worry about.Battery Life: I consider myself a moderate data user. I check my emails off my phone, stream music, and update Twitter/Facebook. I get the phone off my charger about 8am and come home around 9pm. It has about 35% battery life left which is more than my iPhone, it use to have about 10% left.Overall, this phone is a great alternative to the iPhone or any android. Only complaints I have is the camera leaves something to be desired. The OS is smooth and reliable. Microsoft and Nokia hit a home run with the Lumia 800. Give this phone a chance and you won't be disappointed.","156","Nokia","7"

One of the biggest negative comments I've read is about the cover for the charging port, but I absolutely love it - my other phones would gather dust in there over time, not this - and it's easy to open, I have a hard time picturing it breaking unless I just treat it like garbage.You get EDGE on T-Mobile, but that works fine for me - 80% of the time I'm around WiFi anyway.Battery life has been superb, and that's with WiFi and GPS turned on all day, and the screen on it's brightest setting. Always makes me laugh when I see screenshots people post from their iPhones, majority of the time the battery is showing less than 50%. :)Sound quality on calls is actually very good, that was a negative I'd read about it elsewhere. I've not had a problem at all.Speakerphone for music is a B/B-, but I plug it up to a set of external speakers anyway so it's not really an issue.If you want a larger phone, obviously wait for the Lumia 900 to arrive on AT&T this Spring... but if you're like me and like a phone you can operate with one hand, this is a perfect size, perfect performance, and looks stunning.**EDIT**I did the unthinkable yesterday - as I was getting out of my car, my phone was in my lap and launched through the air onto the concrete garage floor, bounced a couple of times, and skidded a few more inches before halting. I just froze, knowing that just a few days earlier I had taken off the case that came with it, because I wanted the sleek feel of the phone in my hand when I used it.I took a deep breath, bent down and picked up the phone, and took it inside under the kitchen lights to review the damage. Once I'd brushed off the dust and other junk it had accumulated on my garage floor (don't judge me!), I realized that there wasn't a scratch on it. NOT ONE! I have no idea what part of the phone it first landed on from 5 feet up, because I couldn't see any damage. The screen is fine, no chips or scratches from the floor, I can't believe it. Still wouldn't recommend doing it, but I feel much better now!","156","Nokia","7"

If you like to play i really recommend this phone cuz its like a xbox portable with the xbox hub, i bought a game called tentacle, i love it, its run smooth and fast.and i know that more are comming so in that matter i dont feel the need of more.the signal reception its AMAZING, the calls are GREAT loud and clear. as a phone are the best thing i ever ever used. good for nokia, i dont know if are the materials or whatever but surfing the web and making calls i can see a notable difference with this phone.if you like to have a different phone that work better than the phone that everybody have (iphone and androids) i really recommend you to give this a opportunity you wont regret it.","156","Nokia","7"

The OS is absolutely beautiful, the screen is amazing and everything runs like butter. Seriously, if you're unsure about buying this phone then all you need to do is to hold one in your hand for a few seconds and your decision will be made for you. A great job by both Nokia and Microsoft in everything from hardware design, to software design.Don't let the negative press about the lack of apps fool you. As of right now, the marketplace has 50,000 apps and from what I've read it's increasing at the rate of a few hundred apps per day. It's more than you want, has everything you need, and you're actually a lot less reliant on apps because of the way Windows Phone works. For those that are really concerned then yes there are fart apps on there too.I believe there's enough information and rave reviews about this phone online to help convince you so I'll throw in a few words about the seller. Global Mobiles did a great job of shipping and packaging, with the Lumia Box coming inside another Black Box all inside of the larger Amazon box. Global Mobiles was also kind enough to include printed instructions on how to get the phone in English (it boots up in German but you just have two clicks to make it English) and an adapter for the charger as the Lumia currently only comes with a Europe type charger. Absolutely satisfied with everything and happy I made this purchase","156","Nokia","7"

I haven't tried it yet, but it does have the US maps available for download (that means the app can work without using data while your driving)Nokia also included a body skin to protect the phone, that thing fits so nicely on the phone, some people I showed it to didn't realize it wasn't part of the phone. It's not bulky like most of these coversI bought this phone from Global Mobile and with the amazon prime service it arrived the next day. The phone is factory unlocked, but it's the German T-Mobile version (they include a little note on the buttons to tap in the startup wizard, basically after two buttons you'll see the language selection where you can select English).I also found out that it's really easy to replace that software with an unbranded UK version.Overall, it's a great phone, very fast and looks great.","156","Nokia","7"
"5827","Nokia Lumia 800 Unlocked GSM Phone with Windows 7.5 OS, 3.7"" AMOLED Multi-Touchscreen, 8MP Camera with Carl Zeiss Optics, Video, GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and FM Radio - Black","99.95","4","First of all, if you are buying this listing you are getting a european version which supports only 3G bands - UMTS 2100, UMTS 1900 and UMTS 900. AT&T uses UMTS 1900 & 850 bands. So you are missing support 850 band. Nokia has another version of the Lumia which supports - 2100, 1900 and 850. AT&T deploys the 1900 or/and 850 networks depending the traffic and usage. So in many areas you would see a lower 3G performance compared to other AT&T devices. I faced this issue in San Diego - La Jolla. So if you are planning to buy Lumia 800, wait until Nokia releases it in Feb 2012 through microsoft store. I am pretty sure Amazon also would carry stock of the Lumia 800 US version.Keeping this version aspect aside, i am extremely impressed with Nokia Lumia 800. Let me list out the pros and cons before explaining the issues in detail ... I mainly compared this phone with Blackberry Bold 9900 and iPhone 4S - since all these phones feature the same modem chipset from Qualcomm. I expected the voice quality and cell coverage performance to be very similar. I am not going to compare this with an Android phone because i haven't used one !** PROS **[1] Polycarbonate body with AMOLED display gives this phone a solid look and feel. No more ""Made in China"", rather ""Made in Finland"" -> Solid quality and finish.[2] Microsoft OS 7.5 + Tiles is an absolute winner on this device.[3] MS Software has been developed predominantly on the QC8655 Chipset which features a single core 1.4 GHz Snapdragon + 3G modem. Since Nokia used the same chipset and being the primary vendor for Redmond OS, i believe the hardware and software design seems to have been very tightly coupled. Hence user interface and responsiveness to user action is top notch on this phone.[4] Without SIM card, you can use an app called Tango to make voice calls over Wi-Fi to other folks who have Tango. Tango app has been developed and distributed on iOS, Windows mobile, android and PC's as well. Email synchronization and MSFT exchange support is awesome.[5] Internet explorer browser on the phone is extremely well developed compared to the sluggish ones on windows mobile 6.5. I would treat the browsing experience to be on par with iPhone 4S.[6] Battery bug which many people are referring to was not observed on my device. So it is not like all the Lumia devices are affected. I see that the battery operates normally and it will last one full day on normal usage.[7] Zune marketplace and music management is pretty good. It's not the best, but it is getting better day by day.[8] Nokia Drive + Nokia Maps - This is probably going to feature only on Nokia WP phone, these two apps are extremely handy. First of all it offers free voice navigation, something that is lacking on my iPhone 4S and the maps can stay offline, still provide you the navigation ![9] Camera - 8 MP, Carl Zeiss lens - Awesome with pictures, but the software sucks ! They really need to update the camera application on the Nokia or Windows side ... This camera is capable of taking some awesome shots, given the right software.** CONS **[1] Battery life is only as good as any other smartphone. It will last only for one full day and not beyond that. Nokia's past reputation of long battery haul is busted on this phone.[2] Voice quality is average compared to Blackberry Bold 9900 & iPhone 4S which uses the same QC8655 chipset.[3] Cell coverage was a little poor - this could be attributed to the fact that this particular unit didn't support one of the 3G bands of AT&T. I am guessing this would be better on the Lumia 800 US version and it should be comparable to Blackberry Bold 9900 and iPhone 4S.[4] Phone's charging port and SIM card slot have an awkward design. I would prefer to have both of them on the side.[5] Coming from Nokia i would expect a slot for additional memory storage as well.[6] You need a windows account to setup your phone. I am not really a fan of this aspect ![7] Syncing contacts to WP phone via Mac is a big headache. As such there are no straightforward steps to do that. You have to export all the contacts to a different format, sync them to your windows mail account and then its get's automatically loaded to your phone ( assuming you have setup email/contacts/calendar based on your windows mail account ).[8] Traversing the email application is quite a challenge. I opened an email thread in my inbox and i could not find a way to return to my inbox right away. I had to read from the particular message all the way to the most recent message in the thread and then return to Inbox.** OVERALL ** - Microsoft/Nokia have struck a winning combination with the Nokia Lumia 800. MSFT marketplace is growing pretty rapidly and i am sure in the next one year or so, there would be plethora of apps to cover everyone's needs. At this point the marketplace cannot compete with Apple iOS but it definitely beats the crap out of a Blackberry.Nokia has truly turned around and have done an excellent job of tying the MSFT OS & their hardware. This is a perfect arrangement and they have set extremely high standards for any other windows phone competitor. They are also making sure they enter the LTE segment with Lumia 900. This is a step in right direction ...Microsoft has been squandering till now with the WP OS. But now they have made a complete turnaround with the Metro UI and tight integration of their software with Nokia hardware. Microsoft should continue promoting the OS and make sure the user experience is top notch. There are some short comings on the UI, which they are probably aware of and will fix in future releases. MSFT should ensure the WP market is lucrative for application developers to jump on and port their application from iOS or Android platform.If you are looking for an iPhone alternative, then this is the phone for you ! If data transfer speeds are important then wait for Nokia Lumia 900 !","156","Nokia","7"

I really wanted to like this phone, but I've got major issues with this one. Every Nokia unlocked (except the N900) has worked flawlessly on my AT&T account. This guy has a MAJOR flaw - no data connection and no MMS on the AT&T network. A minor issue is that it doesn't work with Nokia Suite, so I can't sync my contacts and calendar that way anymore. You need to go through Windows Live. Not a big deal, but I just don't like having MS (or Google - Android) having my personal info.Apparently, there was a patch for the network issue, but I just received the phone today and the first thing I did was to apply software updates. It appears that the patch that should have fixed the problem is no longer available or doesn't work once you've updated the phone.Unless/until Nokia fixes this, I'd recommend staying away from this unit if you're on AT&T.UPDATE*********Things are slightly better. Got the network to work over AT&T - as per one of the other reviewers, set up wap.cingular as apn (that's all!). However, the Network Setup app on the marketplace is no longer out there. There are links to it on the net, but it won't install. Complains about wrong firmware version or no support for AT&T. Nokia announced that this unit will be for sale unlocked in the US in February. Hopefully there will be a patch by then for AT&T.UPDATE 2(1/22/12) **********Network Setup app is back online with Nokia. Now recognize AT&T network. I'm able to get on line and send media texts.Now this device is a keeper!","156","Nokia","7"

So I came to Windows phone 7. I looked amongst the windows phones and initally found the Lumia 900 but alas, it was locked. Then I saw this phone and it seemed to fit the bill. So I ordered it and a few days later, a lumia 800 came to my doorstep. I followed the instructions on the slip of paper inserted in the packaging guiding me through changing the language from German to English (don't worry, it tells you the exact german phrases to press on so that you aren't flying bad), transferred my music transferred over with the Zune utility, gave it a full charge, got it activated at T-mobile with a prepaid plan (seriously, don't bother with subsidised plans, T-mobile prepaid monthly plans are the best bang for the buck) and i was off with Windows Phone 7. The camera takes very good pictures for what it is. I was taking a lot of pictures of the city and i got comments that they came out very well. They seem very sharp and detailed. The phone gets very good battery life, roughly 15 hours with heavy web browsing use. The phone is quite durable and has a nice Gorilla Glass screen so its fine even if you have it in your pocket with your keys. I don't get 3G on the phone at the moment except for a few locations throughout Minneapolis however, this is because T-mobile has not fully rolled out 3G on the bands this phone requires at this point. I can bear with EDGE for the moment given my tasks. Besides, bandwidth caps will deter you from doing anything heavy in terms of streaming, no? All in all, this is the best phone I have ever used. Its sad that it won't be able to be upgraded to Windows Phone 8 but many of those features wouldn't be relevant to a windows phone 7 user anyways (dual-core CPU support doesn't matter if you have a single core processor, support for higher screen resolution doesn't matter if your screen already is beneath that resolution). Still, its worth buying.","156","Nokia","7"

I absolutely love the Windows 7 platform it has the apps you need, and has a kickass camera. at this point nokia is coming out with their windows 8 phone at the end of september, and If its anything like this one its definitely worth the buy.It has a solid construction, and very reliable. Dropped it several times on marble floor and its doing fine. reception is very clear and wifi range is good. One guy said he brought it with him on his trip to mount everest. the camera is an 8MP carl zeiss lens, and takes great photos. The app store is nowhere near as plentiful as android or apple, but it has your most important apps such as facebook, cloud storage, whatsapp, linked in, nokia drive, news, etc. and a lot of cool xbox games like final fantasy.The battery life on this is incredible typically on a full charge you can get a solid 30 hours of use, which includes hourly email updates, weather updates, whatsapp updates, and one news update as well as maybe 100 text messages and a few phone calls. if you talk on skype for 30 minutes it drains the battery like 15 percent, which is pretty good.Overall, my main con of this phone is that the multi-tasking on windows phone could be better ( i really loved the webos multitasking UI). Also its not 4G, but then you should get the lumia 900 if thats what you are looking for. but everything else is solid and just works like it should. I hope windows phone becomes more popular as it has a lot of potential to be as big as the apple.

The up, down volume settings, power button, & camera button are on the right side of the phone. The speaker is at the bottom of the phone. The camera is at the back, in the center of the phone. Overall, I don't like the design of the phone but I can't do anything about it.The phone is terrible. The battery runs out very fast even though I barely use the phone & I mean in terms of camera, internet which means wi-fi. I have to charge the phone daily. I switch off my phone daily at night around 11 p.m. till 8 a.m. While I charge it, the phone is off but it kept turning back on. There's something wrong with the phone. The phone has to be on while charging it, I suppose which is silly. The phone does not indicate that it was fully charged. I have to turn on the screen to see if has been fully charged. how silly!I had a nokia E71. That phone had more built- in applications than this phone does. Only things good about nokia lumia 800 are that it has a decent camera quality & music player.The E71 has a recorder in the phone to record my voice & I could e-mail the file I created. It has a call log to see the call duration & when was the last call. I had mp3 files which were music files- I could choose any of them to set as a ringtone.. When some one calls, the E71 would tell the person's name. Nokia lumia 800 doesn't show me the last call's duration nor do the rest that I mentioned in this paragraph. I will have to install applications to cut out mp3 file or install a voice recorder.Please don't buy this phone. This phone doesn't have the applications I want. I bought this phone through Wireless Everything. Wireless Everything company in NY provide really poor service. I called daily to get a chance to speak to the technician about this phone. The technician never called me back so I never got to speak to one. They didn't care to help me about it so I just returned the phone.","156","Nokia","7"

I'm using the phone with AT&T in NYC. Doesn't work with their HSPA+ (yet? I believe there will be a way to enable the frequency) as far as I can tell but I get 3mbit downstream and 1mbit upstream, which is a-OK.UPDATE #2: Flashed the new 11501 firmware. Battery problem be gone! I unplugged my phone at around 1AM and left it idling. It's now 330PM and battery still at 58% with normal use from 9AM. Great job Nokia. I haven't noticed anything else other than the battery fix though. Added the last star :)-------------------------------------------------------You can love or hate Windows Phone OS, but you have to admit, Nokia sure stepped up their game in designing this beauty.HARDWARE:""Borrowed"" heavily from its N9 sibling, this is one stunning phone to look at. Poly-carbonate body means very scratch resistant and none of that slippery glass surface, unlike a certain smartphone. The curves also make it very comfortable to hold, especially over a long period of time, also unlike a certain square-ish phone. Speaker and microphone neatly at the bottom while micro USB port and sim slot are at the top.The screen is amazing. The 3.7"" Clearblack LCD (aka Super AMOLED or whatever you want to call it) gives you such vibrant colors that my retina-display iPhone 4 looks like a last-gen screen next to it, at least in terms of colors and contrasts. The touchscreen is very sensitive, though I've noticed it can be a bit jumpy at times. No idea if it's a software or hardware problem, or just my screen protector.The only problems I have with the designs are: a) the dedicated camera button. It's a two-stage shutter (slightly press to focus and fully to shoot) is a bit flimsy. b) the micro-USB port cover flips up and can easily be broken. And it stays this way while connected. (This has been remedied with the upcoming Lumia 900 btw.)Overall, this is the best looking phone I've seen in years. Kudos to Nokia for trying something new. And dare I say, they succeeded brilliantly.SOFTWARE:It's Windows Phone 7.5 Mango. You either love it, or hate it.Let me say that coming from Android/iOS, the first main differences I saw were the big and bold tiles, and the minimal homescreen. No gazillions of icons and folders cluttering up the screen. Everything is right there, in your face. Phone, SMS, Mail, Browser are all there and easily accessible the moment you turn on the screen. Very cool, I thought. But then, as an avid app user, I loaded up the Windows Marketplace. And boy, was I in for a huge disappointment. I'd known that this was a new ecosystem and there wouldn't be that many apps yet. But I didn't think that many of the iOS/Android apps (not games, don't care about those) that I often used wouldn't have an alternative for WP (more on this later).I was ready to return the phone. But then (yes, another turning point), I started using it. And I fell in love. The way Live Tiles work, instant updated info without loading the apps. The way ""People"" combines all/most of your social networks into one place. The way I stopped using my phone to do useless things and actually get stuff done. And of course, the way the Lumia 800 felt in my hands. Also, slowly, I started discovering new ways to find the apps that I want/need. Sure, I had to compromise and discarded certain apps that I don't really need, but I did manage to gather a good number of apps in the end.Windows Phone 7.5 isn't perfect. I still hate the way copy/paste is implemented. I still think the keyboard is awkward at times and too sensitive at others. I hate that there's no jailbreak/root, or as WP users call it ""Interop unlock"". Or how background tasking has a 9-processes limit. Or how there's no way to change text size in SMS. Or that the default Marketplace is rather unwelcoming and harder to navigate. And many more. But these minor bugs and inconveniences all become irrelevant when you look at the big picture. Windows Phone 7.5 is a brilliant mobile OS. You might call it the smartphone OS for newbies. I'm guessing the reason why it hasn't attracted that many people yet is the lack of quality phones. We haven't seen anything that is so stylish, so cool that can actually compete with the annual iPhone and monthly Androids. Until now.I'm definitely getting a Lumia 900 when it comes out in a few months (though I'll miss the curved glass). Good job Nokia and Microsoft. You've won me over.Update: I forgot to mention that the 800 has battery issues (doesn't last very long). I hear that there's a new update out that has fixed this problem, but I'm still waiting for them to push it out to my phone. Will confirm when I get it.","156","Nokia","7"

My Jawbone Icon kept connecting and disconnecting. So bought a brand new BlueAnt Q2..same thing. So did a Google Search on Lumia 800 Bluetooth Compatibility and a number of articles and blogs appeared about this issue.Just ordered a Nokia J which I hope will offer full compatibility..(edit) Received the Nokia J and of course it works flawlessly. So Nokia, +10 points for coming up with kickass products, but MINUS 10 for screwing around with your specs so I'm forced to purchase your stuff and can't use other devices like I could with most any phone... (grr) Still leaving at 5 stars though...Also, good for you if you are AT&T.. you will have 3g. I am TMobile and this only works on EDGE. I still love it though. Due to the fast processor, most sites come right up.Anything media-rich you need to WiFi.However, for driving, Nokia Drive uses a satellite-direct GPS that does not require data! Just download your state map (FREE) and everything will come right up as quick as if you were on 4G! Last week I tested this at West Rim of the Grand Canyon and there is NO signal of any kind there.. But Nokia Drive loaded up and operated lightning fast!In all, even with some warts, I think this is a keeper!","156","Nokia","7"

The first thing I saw after opening the package was a piece of paper saying that this phone comes is German because it's manufactured in Europe, this paper is in English and shows you how to set up your phone to any language you want. So I did, I set up mine to English.All the manuals are in German, however, I downloaded the PDF's from nokia.co.uk and they come in English, I know that some people would give it a 4 stars, but as for me, I don't see it as being a problem.The manual is VERY complete and contains all the instructions for the battery itself, thing that is lacking in most of modern electronics and that I consider very important, so, following the instructions, I connected the USB cable in the outlet - which comes with a small white piece of plastic to connect to the outlet, and it comes with the converter, so if you are in US, you won't have a problem at all - and the phone vibrated and it started in German, as expected. I followed the instructions from the paper and there it was, in English.After some basic settings, the phone showed up the Windows Phone screen with the tiles. I really don't understand why people say that the screen is small. I have to say that, HONESTLY, all the phones I used so far, the screen was smaller, so I am pretty satisfied, plus, if the screen is way big, it's kinda uncomfortable to carry around, which doesn't happen with this phone.The screen is bright and looks NICE ! The WiFi set up was really easy, it found all the WiFi networks around me and the keyboard fits ok with my fingers.I can't say too much about the battery life, Nokia said that they will release an update to expand the battery life. For a regular user, it's ok enough.The main reason why I bought a Windows Phone is because in my family, EVERYBODY own either Android phones, and all my friends own iPhones. I think it's smart to try something new and I happy so far. I recommend this product.","156","Nokia","7"

Setup was a breeze; all of Nokia's services work as advertised; right out the box I was able to connect to AT&T HSPA network (where available). I did have to buy a SIM cutter to cut my Focus SIM to fit into the 800, since it uses a micro SIM.Overall my experience has been great, however, the MAJOR problem I have with this phone is the camera. The problem was so major I contacted Amazon to return the phone to the seller. As I've mentioned I have a Samsung Focus, which takes pretty decent photos for a 5MP camera; my iPhone 3g also took decent photos, but when is came to the Lumia 800, after correctly changing the camera settings STILL takes TERRIBLE photos.Other issues I have with this phone are:1. battery life2. Missing features native to WP. i.e. a bunch of camera settings, available on all other WP, are missing3. Although the screen is of EXCELLENT quality, it is too dim/light and has a dark tint to it. Only when the brightness is set to high, using WP light theme, does the screen pop.My recommendation: if you are going to spend $600+ on a phone and you are looking for a phone with a great camera, screen, and battery life get a HTC Titan or an iPhone 4s.","156","Nokia","7"

The phone would not charge and i could not tell how much battery i had left. I looked this up and it has happened on many different devices. They say to take the battery out and reset the phone, and see if that works, but the nokia battery is unremovable. I will have to send this one back ='(......This phone is absolutely amazing and im using it on at&t. This phone is unlocked but you need to go to wireless settings and go to edit apn and add ""wap.cingular"" to make it work with 3g/4g (hspa+) on at&t. The only problem i am having is that i cant sent pictures if i figure out that, if its even possible, then this phone is perfect. The screen is small but it looks amazing and all the nokia extras like nokia drive(navigation) and nokia music make this a great deal. Just pricey at the moment but totally worth it for me.******Here is the fix for not being able to send MMS on AT&T:connect to wifiYou need to go here:[...]The first post right at the top has a link that says ""Zune Link"", you must click on that link on your Lumia 800, it brings you into the app store and lets you download the Nokia Network fix.I used it on my Lumia 800 and it works perfectly, it detected my carrier (AT&T) and then I was able to send MMS messages and connect to the network.","156","Nokia","7"

The numbers in your telephone contacts and your text messaging is in a ridiculously small font which is not adjustable. The font is so small that I can barely make it out when I am wearing my reading glasses, and impossible to read without them. Microsoft apparently has no intention of fixing this problem, as they recently released a software update which allows you to adjust the size of the huge tiles, but not the tiny font. I guess they don't bother to read any of the feedback on the Nokia, or Microsoft Phone websites, where many people have complained about this problem. Additionally, the little cover over the USB charging port broke about two weeks after I bought the phone. This would not be a huge problem, except that without the usb cover in place, the other cover over the SIM card and the battery is loose, and comes off easily (very poor design).

First thing I did was upgrade to wp 8.1 (8 is a great OS, but 8.1 has Cortana and a couple of other great features). This phone is fast, smooth gets great reception and has a surprisingly brilliant display (based on the lower resolution). Front facing camera is kind of horrible, however I'm not someone that takes ""selfies"" anyway, so I never use it.I would DEFINITLY suggest at least a 32 gb micro-SD card.I am using this phone with Straight Talk and it ported easily to them with no problems at all.***EDIT***Just a word of warning, and this is totally my fault and not the fault of the phone. Get a case for this phone. My father is dying of cancer and is on hospice, so I am under stress. That being the case I dropped the phone. The phone still works great, however because of the camera design it is half loosened and the flash no longer works.

"5908","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Black - AT&T - No Warranty","99.98999999999999","5","As background - I previously had a Lumia 521 and it met all my needs - which are mainly texting, an occasional phone call, checking emails, and every once in awhile checking something on the internet. The phone started to overheat to the point I feared my house might burn down one night, and when I couldn't get another Lumia 521 I figured I would maybe make the switch to an android to take advantage of all the apps that are made for android and iphone users which never seem to cover Windows. I have a Samsung Galaxy Player for listening to music and found a Samsung Avant phone that was a good size to fit in my pocket, so figured I would ""upgrade"". What a mistake. That phone was so frustrating. Because my Lumia 521 was ""cheap"" I had been fooled into thinking it was not as good a phone - but it turned out it was actually better. I am not one to quickly replace a phone, but after a month of frustration I couldn't stand it and researched to see what would be a good Nokia phone that might be a good size to fit in my pocket with a slightly better camera than the 521. After careful research I settled on the 820 and so far am pretty glad I did. It is not perfect, but it meets most of my checklist and all of my high priority items. First - I have difficulties getting phones, tablets, etc.. to respond to my touch. Apparently my fingers just aren't recognized. So with the Samsung I would have to swipe 3 or 4 times to get it to work. With the Lumia's it recognizes my touch -every time. I have seen demonstrations of people using them with gloves and they work fine. So whatever that technology might be - it is a great feature and number one in reducing my frustrations. Second, they have a great texting autocorrect. Once you learn to just plow ahead with your incorrect spelling and have faith that one second later the autocorrect will fix it to the right word, you will be in heaven. With the Samsung, the autocorrect was nightmarish. I would have the whole word correct except perhaps the last letter. The Samsung autocorrect would split what I had typed into 3 nonsensical separate words. The time it would take to fix the autocorrect was not worth it and I had to turn it off. Third, I like a microSD card option. The 820 allows for a microSD card - so I know that I can save my pictures, etc., and easily be able to download them or transfer, etc.. The Windows account already backs them up, but it is nice to know that I can have all this extra memory AND just move the card over to a new phone, etc.. Plus, I figure if I do something stupid to my phone, as long as the SD card doesn't get crushed and I can get it out, then I can save all my photos. Fourth, there is a replaceable battery. I cannot understand a phone that wouldn't let you change the battery for a new one once it starts to fail. Fifth, the navigation. The Windows navigation just makes so much more sense. With my Samsung, my teenage daughters would be asking me how to get back to a previous text, etc.. You know a phone is counter intuitive when a teenager needs help using it. I would like to additionally have got a much better camera, but so far the pictures I have taken are just as crummy as the ones on the 521. I now have a flash, which is a good thing, but the camera is still not great. Probably my main knock against it. Another requirement I had is a phone approximately the size of an iPhone so that I can fit it in my pocket. This phone is a really nice size so it scores high for its nice size. If you've never used a windows phone you'll fine the tiles are a really nice feature - I really missed them when I had the Samsung phone. One thing you'll want to keep in mind - and this could be important - is that the phone I got is an AT&T phone. I use T-mobile so this was both good and bad. It was good because for some reason unknown to me, but which I had stumbled upon during my research, only the AT&T branded phones are able to upgrade to Windows 8.1 which has Cortana. The T-Mobile phones are not allowed to upgrade. Apparently upgrades are actually at the discretion of the carrier, and T-mobile doesn't allow it on this phone. So what I did was when I first got the phone, I started it up without a SIM card in it and connected to the wifi. After being connected a little while to the wifi it told me there was an update to 8.1 available for my phone. So I updated it while it thought it was AT&T. I then had to get online and request the unlock code from AT&T . It was easy enough to do and I got the code pretty much right away (it gives you a link to check the status of your request, so I checked that link immediately and my code was right there). However, it does say it could take several days (I think it said up to 5 days) so if you are planning to use your phone right away on T-mobile and AT&T decides to take a long time to give you the unlock code you may be out of luck. So you would think all is well and good but then I realized - and researched - that because this is an AT&T branded phone, I could not get the T-mobile function of making calls over wifi. Apparently that function is a T-mobile specific function that only comes on T-mobile phones. Because I really have only used that function once in the last year, I would rather have Windows 8.1 and Cortana, so I am just as happy that this is an AT&T phone. But you'll have to decide for yourself if that is a problem or not. There may be some other T-Mobile specific functionality that I am now missing but so far I have not stumbled on any. Now I just hope that this one doesn't overheat like my 521 did, because I plan to keep this phone for a good long time.","300","Nokia","7"

"5916","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Black - AT&T - No Warranty","99.98999999999999","3","UPDATE AUG 2016: A few critical items to add to this review, and this should probably knock the stars down (was 4 stars, May 2016): First, I mentioned that I didn't update the phone to 8.1 and as it turns out this was part of my good luck with this phone. When you do the update, you absolutely lose Internet Sharing. There are some kind of hokey tricks you can find on the net to restore this, and one of these may work, but anyway, this is a massive feature loss. Next is that you cannot update this phone to Windows Phone 10. I still have two of these and partly did the 8.1 update to see how much further it could go. 8.1 is it. You can't go further and apparently it's official from Microsoft now that this phone cannot be upgraded to Windows 10 even though it has plenty memory. Finally, Microsoft in their wisdom removed an app from the store called ""Lumia Storage Check (beta)"" that added a critical capability to this phone: storage of map data for Here Drive/Here Maps on the SD card. Even with Windows Phone 8.0, this app gives a message that ""This app is not available for your device."" It seems Microsoft might have made this app completely non-downloadable with these phones even though you can visit it by direct link (link follows). With this app, you could download maps for entire USA to your SD card and it would cost you about 5 GB. This was awesome, because it meant you could travel anywhere in the US and never need to download maps. It makes the app faster and everything better and *used to be* one of the things I would promote on this phone. So of course, Microsoft killed it, probably because they want the moment by moment data of where you are exactly for marketing reasons. Microsoft has no respect for your privacy and they are as bad as Google. (Link to the app so you can check it yourself:[...]I have purchased *three* of these phones in the last month, and let's start with the bad, but keep reading for the good, and the bad is that God knows where these phones come from, though they *appear to be* more or less new as claimed.So here's the bad. The first phone was a complete dud and had this problem that others had mentioned out here: the phone just would not charge! When I pulled it out of the box and turned it on, all appeared to be OK. But it was like it was ""stupid"" about accepting a charger. Once dead, it never turned back on at all, even sitting on the charger for hours! A very strange thing that I've never seen. The seller, who probably didn't know much more about the oddness of this phone than me, thought it was a bad battery and sent me one of those. With this new battery inserted I was again able to turn the phone on! (Because it had irretrievably died.) But the challenge was keeping it running as it would take something like 10 hours to fully charge! I got a battery monitoring app, and this phone was truly weird, taking enormous amounts of time to charge if it was able to charge at all.Needless to say, this first phone went back.I then purchased another one of these same phones (masochist?) from a different seller (not a masochist?) and perhaps just by dumb luck, I had no problems. The two phones came identically packaged. Both the bad and the ""good"" appeared to be completely new. They were still in shrink-wrap in what appeared to be an original Nokia box. They both had a little identification sticker on the outside of the shrink-wrapped plastic. The only difference was that the first ""bad"" one had no screen protector, and you know, these things always have screen protectors when they're new. Both appeared perfect though and new. Now the bad here from any point of view is that these were both *AT&T* phones that apparently had been somehow unlocked. Both phones (the bad and the good) had the AT&T logo in the upper right corner. Both phones had goofy AT&T apps that I didn't want. Both phones would show the AT&T logo when turning on. (Note that both phones were ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" which is the only way I will generally buy a product on Amazon that is sold by a third party seller and that appears to be ""potentially shady."")My intent was to use these on T-Mobile, so I wasn't too thrilled about the AT&T background. I figured I'd have some weird problems with the phone, even if it appeared to more or less work. So the first feature I tried was the mobile hotspot, because I use that and it's very easy to access on all these Windows Phones. So that worked a treat out of the box and seemed to be a little faster than my old Nokia 4G T-Mobile phone. Anyway, it was pretty much to me blazing fast for a cell phone hotspot, at about 4000 Mbits/sec.So that was great. And the phone seemed to work just fine on T-mobile without any issues with texting or with voicemail, etc. But I thought that too soon because there was one issue, and that was with sending pictures in text messages. I noticed this only after a couple weeks with the phone when I needed to do this. It flat out didn't work. I would send the message and like 5 minutes later I'd get a message from the phone that the message could not be sent. The fix for this was to set the APNs of both ""internet"" and ""mms"" (in Settings:cellular:""edit internet/mms apn""). After that all was well with texting.So, it's now about a month later, and this second phone has had no battery issues whatsoever. It seems to charge completely normally and it takes almost precisely 1.5 hours from dead to full charge. As I mentioned I have a battery monitoring app and it is quite nice and tells me exact info on these things. (""Battery Sense"" is the name of the app and I'd strongly recommend it, though it has ads.)The battery life when the phone is on is not spectacular, but previously I had a definitely brand new and ""unshady"" Nokia 521 and its battery life was none too fantastic either, and overall this phone I would say is about the same. The crazy bright screen on this phone which cannot be dimmed much is probably a big reason the thing sucks down juice quickly when being used, because it does seem to run down more quickly when it's doing something I would say, but when not much is going on with the phone, the steady drain seems normal and if I'm not using it as a hotspot during the day or doing a long video, it should make it through the day fine. I would say for sure it has to be put on the charger every night though.So I bought a second phone from the second seller (making three Nokia 820s total, the first from the other seller) and that one too has not had battery issues (knock wood). It charges normally and has normal battery life and everything seems OK.So I have to say I really like this phone except for the stupidly bright (and battery draining) screen and it seems like a very nice upgrade over my Nokia 521. This phone fills the gaps that the 521 had, like the 521 having no flash.I have always had smartphones with a flash, so it was a little irritation with the 521 to not have that. Now I have a flash again, and it's been great, particularly as a flashlight which is probably the main purpose of a flash on these phones. And this phone has a great flash that also enhances the pictures, more than I would expect of a cheap LED flash. Pictures are great on this phone, as I think they tend to be on this vintage of Nokias. This one seems to have an upgraded camera as well over the 521 and it is very nice. The 521 has an amazing camera for its price, and takes quite nice video again for the price, and so this phone does that and does it better. The flash really seems to improve picture quality more than I would have expected and the pictures have a really tightly focused and nicely lit and color balanced quality. The flash particularly helps I think because the phone uses the flash to figure out exposure settings even when you have the flash turned off and that seems to work fantastically. For example, close-ups with this phone come out great. So this phone is much better than the 521 camera-wise and the 521 as I say was very good.There's also a front facing camera which honestly I don't use much but I know to lots of people this is a key feature.The major big upgrade with this phone is speed though as it is observably faster than the 521, and I'm talking about user interface responsiveness and such. With the 521 I wrote a review saying that the Windows 8.1 upgrade was *not good* partly due to the slow-down. With this phone I can tell that that would be less of a concern, but still I am not upgrading to 8.1 as I particularly don't like the ""androidization"" of the top of the screen and I also don't like that stupid and overdone Cortana thing as it's a dumb form of Siri imitation and it *makes things take longer.* This phone still has that same female voice, but it's not irritating and making everything slower and it's not in your face with its clever ""personality."" It just works and shuts the hell up as much as possible which is how it should be.Anyway, back to performance, the huge selling point of this phone has to do indirectly you might say with speed, and it's the 1 GB RAM versus the Nokia 521's 512 MB RAM. So this phone doubles the RAM, and RAM is a critical need on these phones, especially when you're talking about potentially doing the updates.So even though there was the initial problem with one of these, I really like this phone and the main bad feature is the stupidly bright screen, which contributes to the other bad feature which is the battery life not being a huge improvement over the 521 I previously had. Note that every iPhone out there allows you to dim the hell out of the screen *out of the box* - no app needed! This feature is sometimes a critical need when you are somewhere where you cannot charge and need to conserve juice at all costs! This is not an ""optional"" feature on a cell phone but a must have! Let us turn down the stupid screen ffs!So that's the massive bad feature in this phone which was not a problem on the 521. The 521 has the same limited settings but has a fairly dim screen at the lowest settings. But all in all, this is a nicer, quicker, more full-featured phone than the 521, and still at a ridiculous price! (Note: I paid $110)","300","Nokia","7"

Also, there are far fewer available apps for Windows phones than for Apple or Android phones. Battery life is not great, probably less than most other phones. There have been some other annoying quirks like problems in sending photos or movies by email. To conclude, if you want a low cost phone with good camera and fast LTE speeds, this might be good for you.

If you use the Windows button then press the back button it will return to the program you closed (doesn't happen on Android). There are many very useful apps for this OS. Offline maps and translators are quite useful when you're traveling, especially when they're free.The phone itself is nicely designed, simple and clean, and the build quality seems good. The battery cover is a bit difficult to remove (make sure you have everything you want/need to put in when you do this, so it's only required once). The camera is very good and the pictures are clear. For the individual who sat on his phone, it's not shocking at all that it broke, and quite uncertain whether Gorilla Glass would have made a difference.","300","Nokia","7"

"5935","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Black - AT&T - No Warranty","99.98999999999999","5","I am loving my new phone. After much searching, reading reviews and comparison shopping I am glad to end up with the Nokia 820. It generally got good reviews and has not disappointed me in any way after a couple of weeks of use. The one thing the reviews made me worry about was that moving up to this full sized smartphone would seemed like I would be carrying a huge brick, I have found that the Nokia 820 phone fits nicely in my front pocket (I am a blue jeans wearing male) and although it is a little bit heavy in the hand it feels very sturdy and well built and doesn't seem like a burden in the pocket.Naturally I have not completely figured out all of the features of my new phone but I have done my best to get to the ones I anticipate using most often. Music, photos and productivity software all works great on the Nokia. The hardware for taking photos have produced really nice images in a variety of settings and lighting conditions. I haven't printed them out yet but they look good on my desktop screen even when I zoom in on small portions of the picture. The music plays nicely on my headphones and the speaker is acceptable but a little quiet. The loud speaker plays best when placed on a hard surface but if you really want to listen without headphones I recommend getting some external speakers. The music apps preloaded worked great and everything was instantly responsive.This is my first full feature smartphone and so I was not tied into any of the OS ecosystems that are out there. Since I use Microsoft Windows in my work setting it was a relatively easy thing to learn the Windows phone layout. In fact learning new things about my phone has actually increased the usefulness of my home and work computers as I starting syncing more and more of my data across devices. From the productivity standpoint I am now totally sold on the usefulness of this smartphone. I regularly use my e-mail, OneNote and Skydrive accounts throughout my day and have found that the phone seamlessly keeps everything up to date.Speaking of Apps...now I understand why people make such a big deal about the limits of the Windows app store. It isn't like there aren't a ton of apps to choose from but often you start with a web page that you use a lot and then get the mobile app. If that app isn't supported you could go out and find something similar but it just isn't the same. You often have invested time and energy in the original web site and so it feels like a loss to start over with a different app. I don't think this will be a big deal with me but I can see it frustrating people who are more tied to their apps. The phone works great with the apps it has available but you might look to see if your favorite cookbook, movie streaming service or bird app is available for Windows phone if you are choosing which OS you want to live with.Finally and probably most importantly for the supplier of my phone, I would highly recommend purchasing through these guys. They shipped my phone incredibly quickly and provided the exact product described. The unlocked phone naturally comes from overseas and they sent a plug adapter along with it so it was immediately functional. (Quick note: even though my phone was marked for sale in Saudi Arabia, absolutely everything works in good 'ol American English and all the standard apps and features were present from the moment I turned it on.) I had a some questions about the phone and the suppliers replied within half a day if not faster - even on the weekend!","300","Nokia","7"

It was great came in a nice nokia box every accesory was original and new. (charger, earphones, battery and battery cover).I decided to buy a new one since I had such a great experience last time so I bought one (blindly and happily) from ROSS CELLULAR died within two days of use. (apparently tailwind international does not have these anymore)For my third try decided to go with BREED and when I tried to charge it nothing happened (did not charge). Tried different methods but nothing worked. So I just sent it back.I bought a third one (same week) from THE WIRELESS CIRCLE. I am really hoping for a better product. Will update review when I receive the phone.I am totally certain that the products I received from BREED and ROSS CELLULAR were not new factory unlocked phones. They were USED/REFURBISHED. The phones came in identical at&t boxes and had aftermarket screen protectors on the screens. The batteries although sealed had charge on them and had scrapes and fingernail scratches. The battery cover also had scrapes and fingernail scratches (even though it came in a fake sealed package). My second phone, from ROSS CELLULAR (the one that didnt charge) came with everything installed on it (I didnt even have to go through the first setup steps, I just powered it on and it went right to the start screen.) NEITHER OF THE TWO HAD ANY ACCESORIES ONLY PHONE & CHARGER. The most curious thing of all is that everything was identical even thought they came from different sellers. (box, fake battery cover, fake screen cover, used battery). Its like someone has a big stockpile of junk cell phones and these sellers just re-sell the junk.So be very careful just your sellers wisely I will update my experience with THE WIRELESS CIRCLE when I get my hopefully new cellphone","300","Nokia","7"

"5971","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Black - AT&T - No Warranty","99.98999999999999","5","First, a little background, for perspective: I'm an ex-iphone user, migrated from iphone to Android a few years ago, for the freedom and open-ness of the OS. I've really liked the Android OS and the phones I've bought along the way. A few months ago I bought a Lumia 521 with a new Metro PCS account. The Lumia 521 introduced me to Windows 8 Phone OS and I was amazed at how fluid, intuitive and FUN it is - so I decided to fork out for a premium Windows Phone ... which is what brought me to the Lumia 820.The NOKIA LUMIA 820 is SOLID. It's heavy in the hand and has a stable, durable feel to it. The display is vibrant and beautiful. Reviewers and ""experts"" out there on the web can say anything they want about resolution, rag on the pixel density, whatever - but this phone, in your hand is BEAUTIFUL. Colors pop, photos are crisp and videos look great!As was the case with my (brief) experience on the Lumia 521, this is quick, nimble, FAST. Every operation is there when called for, tasks present themselves immediately and close just as quickly. There's something about this Windows OS that must be much less resource-intensive, less hungry than other mobile OS's, because things just pop and fly all over the place.The Tiles ... live tiles, that represent what feels like a living, breathing OS Interface. You see the faces of your contacts and friends rotating in and out of the ""People"" tile ... Facebook posts of friends ""pop up"" in live time, as they are happening ... News updates circulate in a tile, the tile suddenly flips over to reveal another breaking headline ... the tile from your Songza app suddenly flips over to say ""It is Friday Night"" (or late Saturday morning, etc.) ... the Photos tile rotates through your albums, scrolling slowly and continuously ... nothing stands still, this tiled-interface is alive!More on Tiles ... you can size and re-size your tiles, according to taste; regular (square), large (rectangle that covers width of the screen) or small (one quarter size of regular). You can even Pin your favorite websites to the screen, each in a tile of it's own. I've got four favorite Playlists (from Nokia Music) pinned to my screen, each re-sized to small, and they form a little music ""block"", the size of a regular tile!The Lumia 820 has NFC capability and Wireless Charging - something I didn't think I'd ever need or use, but I did fork out for the charging plate and it's been a very nice bonus. I've already grown lazy, with the ability to simply place the phone on it's back for a charge ... no plugs, cables or hassles.CUSTOMIZATION! Unlike other phones in the Lumia lineup, this one has interchangeable back plates. Once in place, it looks like a solid piece of polycarbonate. You can make this a Cyan phone, a bright Red phone, Yellow, White or Black, simply by putting a different (removable) back plate on it. You can order these with or without NFC and Wireless Charging capability. This phone was black when I bought it, I've since changed it to Cyan (and have other colors on order).Is the 920 a better phone? How about the 928? Well, the specs are better on those phones, but for me, this is the sweet spot. It's smaller than the 920, but with the same screen size, and (again), with the joy of body / color customization. Processing speed? System RAM? What are those??? What do I care? When a phone is as fast, fluid, stable and zippy as this is, who cares? When you get a phone that performs as beautifully as this, you can forget about specs (and forget the ""expert"" opinions from the tech sites). None of it matters.Apps ... yes, you hear a lot of whining, complaining, hand-wringing criticism of the Windows app store and it's ""horrible dearth of apps"". If you believe what you read out there on the internet, you probably figure they've got about 10 or 20 apps in the store. I don't know WHO these people are, or WHAT they have on their own phones, but inasmuch as the Windows store has over a hundred thousand apps (126,000 as of last night) ... I feel that is enough for me (and for any reasonable person). Sure, you can bolster your app store to a million, 50 million, a billion, whatever - but when 50,000 of those apps are flashlights (as opposed to one flashlight), how is that improving your app experience?The 8GB of internal space ... once the OS requirements are subtracted, you've got about 5 or 6 gigs to yourself. Unlike it's bigger brethren in the Lumia family, this one comes with a Micro SD slot. I've got a 32GB card in mine, and have set the phone to load all photos, music and videos to the card (rather than to internal storage). That should hold me for awhile.The Camera ... with Carl Zeiss optics and Dual LED Flash, the 8.7 megapixel camera and quality of your photos will be excellent. I've also loaded an HDR app from the store and have experimented with it, garnering some very nice results. I've been taking photos for Instagram, Foodspotting, Facebook and Twitter so far, nothing that requires a critical eye or instrument. I have also set my phone to auto-upload all photos and videos to Skydrive, so I've got an instant backup of everything I've taken.I'm not going to spend any time hashing-out or ""reviewing"" technical details, you'll get plenty of that in other reviews (and websites). Suffice it to say, this is one of the best and THE most enjoyable phone I've ever owned.","300","Nokia","7"

And the other broke when it fell 3 1/2 feet onto a hardwood floor.She now has a case with adequate corner protection.Also, the device I just bought was listed as new, but was actually an open box factory refurb. We kept it as it was a good enough price, and I expect all the resellers only have factory refurbs at this point due to the age of the device.","300","Nokia","7"

"5986","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Black - AT&T - No Warranty","99.98999999999999","3","First of all, I bought two Nokia L820 from Blutekusa (fulfillment by Amazon) as new factory unlocked 4G LTE penta bands: (800/900/1800/2100/2600 MHz), however I received 2 AT&T unlocked Lumia 820 (Variant RM-824) which is a dual band LTE (1700/700 MHz) with no standard accessories (Nokia AC-50U MicroUSB Charger, Nokia Charging and Data Cable (CA-190CD)) or earphones. I received a no brand generic Chinese charger that it is not able to remain attached to the cell phone during charging because of the weakness of its attachment clips at the micro usb connector. Everybody knows that AT&T devices never come factory unlocked, they are exclusively manufactured for its network, so these Cells are not new they were refurbished to be unlocked. Moreover, I think that the back shell is not original because it arrived with a little dent in one of its corners and with no brand (Nokia/AT&T) or parte number it is completely flat (inside and outside) and is so weak that I damaged a corner with the nail trying to remove the shell to install the battery. I was able to update the OS to WP Amber and it works really fast.As you can see on previous reviews Nokia L820 is a really good cell phone (a little giant but not excellent) with fluent WP8 but with really two big sins: the 1650mAh Battery is too little for all things that you can do with this cell phone and the lacking of gorilla glass.","300","Nokia","7"

I was very happy so far, however I realized that camera is not stable on the back. One side have higher elevation and I had to push it and tape it, My suggestion for people who wants to buy this phone is to but a protective cover which covers around camera and help it to be stable.It was also not mentioned on the ad but the phone was at&t unlocked phone. Every time you turn it on, you will see the logo of the at&t and I was reading that only way to get rid of it was to reset the phone. But I am kinda afraid of doing reset since it may cause to disappear some of the apps already there.If I had not realized the camera problem, the phone could be awesome.","300","Nokia","7"

There are some useful 'live tiles' and many good apps but I am amazed there is not a decent clock/ alarm live tile.The phone is very solid, a little heavy but I like the heft. The screen is bright but not as bright as most Samsungs or the Moto X I bought at the same time. I really like the Moto X! Also the screen is smaller than many phones now offered. The camera takes good pictures which was a selling point. I was able to upload pics directly to Onedrive then use them in a classified ad uploaded from my desktop. While not a unique capability it worked well.This phone has 4G which was a must - many phones in its price range did not. But since I bought this the newer Lumia 625 has come down in price.

"6050","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Black - AT&T - No Warranty","99.98999999999999","1","The Hardware==============Call Quality - Excellent (Typical of all Nokia Phones)The Build Quality - Excellent (Typical of all Nokia Phones)The screen - Good, vibrant, scratch resistant and repels facial grease, IS NOT GORILLA GLASS and is noticeably more fragile.Loudspeaker - A little on the soft sideThe Software==============I have been an avid Windows user since Windows 98, and a Windows Phone user since Windows Phone 7.Windows over the years has gotten more capable and much faster with time. Windows XP to Vista was a little buggy but it worked. Windows Vista to 7 was just a case of slothering Vista in butter and polishing it up to a fine sheen.Windows Phone 7 to Windows Phone 8 has been the experience nightmares are made of. It was basically going from Windows 7 to Windows 95.Windows Phone 7 was an elegant experience for me minus some minor quirks here and there. The most noticeable one was the inability to assign more than one mobile number to any one contact which was rather odd. Others were like not being able to multiselect files or difficulty putting ringtones and audiobooks on the device.They weren't deal breakers and there were some workarounds. That said, everything else in the OS was fully functional. The phones available has very limited storage, most maxing out at 16gbs. However as many figured out, the 1st generation WP7 devices uses MicroSD cards in place of soldered in onboard memory and with a little trick and the right SD Card, could take a 8gb phone and transform it into a 32gb phone. I did it with no problems on my 8gb Dell Venue Pro. Even better, integration with the Zune Desktop Software (ZDS) made syncing music, pictures, podcasts and videos to a lesser extent, a breeze.When i got home, I put my phone to charge, it would ping my desktop wirelessly, fire up the ZDS and start syncing my new podcasts and music automatically to my phone. When I left for work the next morning, everything just worked.Window Phone 8 is nothing like that. With this new OS, expandable storage is natively supported except on my Lumia 820 it doesn't work at all. When i put in my Sandisk 64gb MicroSDXC card, and fired up Windows Media Player to Sync my playlists as I did with my Zune and Windows Phones on the ZDS. (I did this with my old sandisk E250 player back in the PlayForSure days as well)My first thought, ""Wow this is slow!!""Second thought, ""why is song taking to long to transfer?""10 minutes later ""why is the same song still transferring""30 minutes later ""oh *uck it froze""Then something that never happened on my WP7 Dell Venue Pro happened, my Music and Video app crashed, so did my settings app. On shutting it down, it was permanently frozen on the goodbye screen.I forced restarted it by removing the battery.When i powered it up, the SD Card was missing... I turned off the phone, removed the card and put it back in, powered the phone on and it was still missing. I took the card out and put it in a card reader on the PC. The disc check utility detected an inconsistency on the Card and ran but found no errors. Once it was back in the phone, the phone saw it once more. I tried syncing a playlist again, it transferred on playlist and froze in the middle of another.This happened over and over. Then I quick formatted the card back in exfat on my PC and tried syncing playlists directly to the card without the phone between them. Every song synced perfectly.Once back in my phone, all the songs turned up but... for some odd reason, some songs would turn up with no artist or album information. If i resynced them, or copied them manually, they would then show with the correct info, but then other songs would start doing the same thing, to no fault of the songs themselves because they all worked fine on my Zunes and DVP.Using explorer to drag and drop lots of small numerous files, music and pics mainly, always results in some sort of freezing during copying.In the end I gave up although I was able to do some podcast subscriptions directly on my phone by changing my country to USA so I could have some sort of entertainment on my phone for when I was driving or waiting in line. This is still a problem because when I want to view podcasts on my TV or desktop while I work with my nice sounding speakers... I can't.Over the last 2 days something else has started happening which is doubly annoying. For some odd reason, my music videos and pictures have started duplicating and triplicating themselves.If i plug in the phone and navigate to the directory, there is only one physical file even thought the phone sees 2 or 3 of them.Whats worse is if I delete even one of the duplicates, all of the duplicates including the original are deleted.The Nokia Lumia 820 is a horrible phone===========================================This is coming from someone who has owned only Nokia phones his whole life aside for a Dell Venue Pro and an Ericsson and has been a massive fan of Microsoft's Zune Software and Hardware devices as well as the Windows Phone 7 line of devices.NOTHING works like it ought to and despite how much I loved WP7, I cannot recommend this phone to anyone out there.I cannot even return it for a refund because it was bought in the USA and I live in Trinidad and Tobago.If other Windows Phone 8 handsets give the same problem as this Lumia 820, I recommend avoiding them until Microsoft and the OEM's get their house in order and fix what was not broken in Windows Phone 7.5 to begin with.","300","Nokia","7"

Maybe I can retire it for an Android phone as it has nearly all the features and functionality Symbian has.","300","Nokia","7"

To be more specific, we like its solid build quality and its overall size and feel. The hardware is also good, while the Nokia-branded apps, especially Maps and Drive+ are major differentiators.However, the weak camera and poor call quality are major flaws, which cannot be understated. If these aren't that much of deal-breakers for you, then we see no reason not to recommend the 820, but if you're looking for a well-balanced and all-round solid performer, better start thinking about something better, like the Lumia 920.please visit [...]","300","Nokia","7"

If this cell was AT&T device, this cell is not new, it was refurbished to be unlocked. The box is all worn out, dirty and like it was used before.

I wanted a sturdy phone with expandable storage that ran the Windows OS. That is what I got with this phone. It's pretty much the perfect size for my hand, not too thick, but doesn't feel cheap. That back pops off and the battery is removable, another plus that I wasn't even looking for. The wireless charging cases are pretty cheap ($15 off at&t website) so I'll be getting one of those soon, the charging plate is probably a little more expensive though. A protective case fits right over the removable back and can reportedly be charged wirelessly through it. (For those that don't know, the back of this phone is removable, that's where the wireless charging case goes. A protective cover can go on top of that for even more durability). The sound quality isn't the best I've ever had, but then again I don't really like talking on the phone in the first place, so this gives me an excuse when my wife is chattering on and on and on. And on and on. And on again. Hmm...I hope she never sees this review...Anywho, I digress....this phone is exactly what I was looking for. Not too fancy, will most likely last me more than the 2-year contract that I'm used to with smart phones. I like it much better than my previous HTC Windows 8X which felt cheap and had only 8GB of memory. Both are better than my previous Android phone as I much prefer the Windows OS.","300","Nokia","7"

"6066","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Black - AT&T - No Warranty","99.98999999999999","4","I've been using a small Sony Xperia X8(android) for 2 years so I decided to give this Nokia a try.I've always been pro-Windows so I decided to buy this phone because it was now cheap, even though it was released like 2 years ago.I bought it Unblocked on April 2014, from ABCellPROS:- Overall quality is very good. Nokia never lets me down.- Wireless tethering(Internet sharing) thats good!!- I can choose to navigate pages as a desktop browser and not as a mobile browser which has some restrictions by some sites. (Update 2014-Oct: Not anymore with the latests updates)- It has mini versions of Word and Excel included.- The main icons screen is very easy to use and to manage.- Video playback is smooth and looks good.- The file structure of the SD card is very simple, not like Androids which is filled with dozens of folders.- Good cameraCONS:- The battery life is bad, but since mine is a used one I can not say if the new ones are better.- Not so good MP3 player. Too confusing. I just needed a simple player.- Bad MP3s codecs, could not play some of my 320Kbps songs, like my Sony Xperia X8 did easily. However an app called Pocket File Manager did play these songs well, I did not expect that from a file management app.- The flashlight is not full white, it has like some kind of warmth in it, so some photos might look warm(yellowish).- One of the three main buttons is dedicated entirely to Bing search. I don't like Bing, so for me it is a big waste of a button that could have been useful for any other function. (Update 2014-Aug: the WP 8.1 Update changed this to Cortana a voice assistant. Nice!!)- Very grainy photos in low light when flash is not used.- On the internet browser, part of the screen (like 15% I guess) is wasted displaying the URL the whole time. (Update 2014-Aug: I installed another browser)- No ""forward"" button or feature on the internet browser. (Update 2014-Aug: the WP 8.1 Update added this feature)- No OTG. OTG lets you connect keyboard, mouse, flash memory and other USB devices to the phone.- I can not organize my photos and images in custom albums.FINAL THOUGHTS:Even though the phone has almost everything I need, it always leaves me the feeling that I'm isolated( or imcompatible) from the Android population. The grass is greener....Unless Microsoft make some huge improvements on these phones in the near future, I think that I'll eventually go back to Android sooner or later.2014-Aug-13 UPDATE:- I'm not missing Android that much as I thought I was going to be.- Sadly the headphone jack has stopped working, it seems like is an issue that a lot of people is having according to what I have read on the internet.- Still satisfied with this phone.2014-Oct-15 UPDATE:- Suddenly the headphone jack started to work again. I think because of the latest updates. So I guess it was a software problem.- The battery life is starting to upset me. It only lasts a few hours when connected phone company network.- The assistant Cortana is looking very helpful, unfortunately only works when there's internet.May 2015 - Final Update:- The headphone jack broke again. I don't know if it is a hardware or software problem.- With the accumulation of photos I needed a folder feature in photos which it never came with updates.I finally gave up and bought a Samsung Galaxy K Zoom. It has a decent battery, photos that can be organized in folders, OTG, etcI still love Nokia, and expect to go back someday when they have a better device.Thanks for reading.","300","Nokia","7"

Coming from Android, there was a little learning curve, but it was pretty ease to figure it out and teach her how to use it. The one thing that was really a pain is that the firmware (operating system) on it is really out of date and some of the features of the device will not work until you update it to the latest firmware release. This would not be a problem, but you have to update it in multiple steps, and each steps takes about an hour. But once you get it fully updated, it seems to work fine. She has had very little problem with except for it not wanting to let her send pictures through text. Not sure what the problem is there. It might be the phone or a compatibility issue with AT&T.

Also, it wasn't mentioned anywhere in the product description, but the phones seem to be intended for use in Mexico. They work in the US because GSM is an international standard, but all of the documentation and user manuals are in Spanish only. When you do a factory reset on the phone, it defaults to Spanish as well.

"6111","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Black - AT&T - No Warranty","99.98999999999999","4","Whoa, I've been on Android since the HTC/Google G1, so I'm taking a risk. I don't want to pay a high price, but I wanted a newer phone (I was on a cracked Samsung GS for 2 1/2 years). So, getting more tech for less was important and this was the best compromise (1/2 the price of the Samsung GS4 mini and I don't want a billboard in my pocket, ya know).Nokia delivered! They're trying hard to keep up with Google and Apple. WP8 leaves some major gaps, but those will be filled by vendors as the app store develops as well as MS when they mature the OS. Still, I'm pretty blown away with the tech and OS. If it weren't for the lack of apps, I'd never think about going back to Android, but the lack of apps is a headache for WP8. Some minor integration issues that I'm used to (dialing a number and getting a name, for instance) are a problem, but the way WP8 imported all my contacts from the cloud made that tolerable.You can read many more detailed reviews, but from someone who could use Android pretty well and was willing to stay on the leading edge of yesterday with an old, cracked phone that wouldn't die, I will say that WP8 is a nice way to update my tech without paying a lot of money. For the price I paid, I'd do it again, and WP8 is very serviceable. Once the app store starts rolling, Android and iOS may be in for a run. Bottom line: I'm happy with my phone and WP8, I'll definitely keep this set up for a while.Happy Shopping.","300","Nokia","7"

It says it is unlocked, but doesn't work for Sprint. It works perfectly for T-Mobile though. Before this phone, I used a T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G, a first generation android. That was small 3' or so and very light. I wasn't looking for the latest smartphone (iPhone), but something affordable and efficient for basic functions. This phone is it. It's 4'3"" and heavier, but it fits well since I easily drop my phone. It operates on Windows 8 and contains features and apps that are easily accessible and easy to use, such as Facebook, Twitter, Nokia Maps, etc. It has an 8-megapixel rear camera, but a very bad front camera, 0.3 megapixel. Hence, it's decent camera quality. I am a tad sad that I can't take good ""selfies."" Since I use my phone moderately and its functions, its battery life lasts long, though I've only had it for about 3 weeks. Good performance overall and fast connection Internet with 4G.","300","Nokia","7"
"6156","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Black - AT&T - No Warranty","99.98999999999999","3","UPDATE AUG 2016: A few critical items to add to this review, and this should probably knock the stars down (was 4 stars, May 2016): First, I mentioned that I didn't update the phone to 8.1 and as it turns out this was part of my good luck with this phone. When you do the update, you absolutely lose Internet Sharing. There are some kind of hokey tricks you can find on the net to restore this, and one of these may work, but anyway, this is a massive feature loss. Next is that you cannot update this phone to Windows Phone 10. I still have two of these and partly did the 8.1 update to see how much further it could go. 8.1 is it. You can't go further and apparently it's official from Microsoft now that this phone cannot be upgraded to Windows 10 even though it has plenty memory. Finally, Microsoft in their wisdom removed an app from the store called ""Lumia Storage Check (beta)"" that added a critical capability to this phone: storage of map data for Here Drive/Here Maps on the SD card. Even with Windows Phone 8.0, this app gives a message that ""This app is not available for your device."" It seems Microsoft might have made this app completely non-downloadable with these phones even though you can visit it by direct link (link follows). With this app, you could download maps for entire USA to your SD card and it would cost you about 5 GB. This was awesome, because it meant you could travel anywhere in the US and never need to download maps. It makes the app faster and everything better and *used to be* one of the things I would promote on this phone. So of course, Microsoft killed it, probably because they want the moment by moment data of where you are exactly for marketing reasons. Microsoft has no respect for your privacy and they are as bad as Google. (Link to the app so you can check it yourself:[...]I have purchased *three* of these phones in the last month, and let's start with the bad, but keep reading for the good, and the bad is that God knows where these phones come from, though they *appear to be* more or less new as claimed.So here's the bad. The first phone was a complete dud and had this problem that others had mentioned out here: the phone just would not charge! When I pulled it out of the box and turned it on, all appeared to be OK. But it was like it was ""stupid"" about accepting a charger. Once dead, it never turned back on at all, even sitting on the charger for hours! A very strange thing that I've never seen. The seller, who probably didn't know much more about the oddness of this phone than me, thought it was a bad battery and sent me one of those. With this new battery inserted I was again able to turn the phone on! (Because it had irretrievably died.) But the challenge was keeping it running as it would take something like 10 hours to fully charge! I got a battery monitoring app, and this phone was truly weird, taking enormous amounts of time to charge if it was able to charge at all.Needless to say, this first phone went back.I then purchased another one of these same phones (masochist?) from a different seller (not a masochist?) and perhaps just by dumb luck, I had no problems. The two phones came identically packaged. Both the bad and the ""good"" appeared to be completely new. They were still in shrink-wrap in what appeared to be an original Nokia box. They both had a little identification sticker on the outside of the shrink-wrapped plastic. The only difference was that the first ""bad"" one had no screen protector, and you know, these things always have screen protectors when they're new. Both appeared perfect though and new. Now the bad here from any point of view is that these were both *AT&T* phones that apparently had been somehow unlocked. Both phones (the bad and the good) had the AT&T logo in the upper right corner. Both phones had goofy AT&T apps that I didn't want. Both phones would show the AT&T logo when turning on. (Note that both phones were ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" which is the only way I will generally buy a product on Amazon that is sold by a third party seller and that appears to be ""potentially shady."")My intent was to use these on T-Mobile, so I wasn't too thrilled about the AT&T background. I figured I'd have some weird problems with the phone, even if it appeared to more or less work. So the first feature I tried was the mobile hotspot, because I use that and it's very easy to access on all these Windows Phones. So that worked a treat out of the box and seemed to be a little faster than my old Nokia 4G T-Mobile phone. Anyway, it was pretty much to me blazing fast for a cell phone hotspot, at about 4000 Mbits/sec.So that was great. And the phone seemed to work just fine on T-mobile without any issues with texting or with voicemail, etc. But I thought that too soon because there was one issue, and that was with sending pictures in text messages. I noticed this only after a couple weeks with the phone when I needed to do this. It flat out didn't work. I would send the message and like 5 minutes later I'd get a message from the phone that the message could not be sent. The fix for this was to set the APNs of both ""internet"" and ""mms"" (in Settings:cellular:""edit internet/mms apn""). After that all was well with texting.So, it's now about a month later, and this second phone has had no battery issues whatsoever. It seems to charge completely normally and it takes almost precisely 1.5 hours from dead to full charge. As I mentioned I have a battery monitoring app and it is quite nice and tells me exact info on these things. (""Battery Sense"" is the name of the app and I'd strongly recommend it, though it has ads.)The battery life when the phone is on is not spectacular, but previously I had a definitely brand new and ""unshady"" Nokia 521 and its battery life was none too fantastic either, and overall this phone I would say is about the same. The crazy bright screen on this phone which cannot be dimmed much is probably a big reason the thing sucks down juice quickly when being used, because it does seem to run down more quickly when it's doing something I would say, but when not much is going on with the phone, the steady drain seems normal and if I'm not using it as a hotspot during the day or doing a long video, it should make it through the day fine. I would say for sure it has to be put on the charger every night though.So I bought a second phone from the second seller (making three Nokia 820s total, the first from the other seller) and that one too has not had battery issues (knock wood). It charges normally and has normal battery life and everything seems OK.So I have to say I really like this phone except for the stupidly bright (and battery draining) screen and it seems like a very nice upgrade over my Nokia 521. This phone fills the gaps that the 521 had, like the 521 having no flash.I have always had smartphones with a flash, so it was a little irritation with the 521 to not have that. Now I have a flash again, and it's been great, particularly as a flashlight which is probably the main purpose of a flash on these phones. And this phone has a great flash that also enhances the pictures, more than I would expect of a cheap LED flash. Pictures are great on this phone, as I think they tend to be on this vintage of Nokias. This one seems to have an upgraded camera as well over the 521 and it is very nice. The 521 has an amazing camera for its price, and takes quite nice video again for the price, and so this phone does that and does it better. The flash really seems to improve picture quality more than I would have expected and the pictures have a really tightly focused and nicely lit and color balanced quality. The flash particularly helps I think because the phone uses the flash to figure out exposure settings even when you have the flash turned off and that seems to work fantastically. For example, close-ups with this phone come out great. So this phone is much better than the 521 camera-wise and the 521 as I say was very good.There's also a front facing camera which honestly I don't use much but I know to lots of people this is a key feature.The major big upgrade with this phone is speed though as it is observably faster than the 521, and I'm talking about user interface responsiveness and such. With the 521 I wrote a review saying that the Windows 8.1 upgrade was *not good* partly due to the slow-down. With this phone I can tell that that would be less of a concern, but still I am not upgrading to 8.1 as I particularly don't like the ""androidization"" of the top of the screen and I also don't like that stupid and overdone Cortana thing as it's a dumb form of Siri imitation and it *makes things take longer.* This phone still has that same female voice, but it's not irritating and making everything slower and it's not in your face with its clever ""personality."" It just works and shuts the hell up as much as possible which is how it should be.Anyway, back to performance, the huge selling point of this phone has to do indirectly you might say with speed, and it's the 1 GB RAM versus the Nokia 521's 512 MB RAM. So this phone doubles the RAM, and RAM is a critical need on these phones, especially when you're talking about potentially doing the updates.So even though there was the initial problem with one of these, I really like this phone and the main bad feature is the stupidly bright screen, which contributes to the other bad feature which is the battery life not being a huge improvement over the 521 I previously had. Note that every iPhone out there allows you to dim the hell out of the screen *out of the box* - no app needed! This feature is sometimes a critical need when you are somewhere where you cannot charge and need to conserve juice at all costs! This is not an ""optional"" feature on a cell phone but a must have! Let us turn down the stupid screen ffs!So that's the massive bad feature in this phone which was not a problem on the 521. The 521 has the same limited settings but has a fairly dim screen at the lowest settings. But all in all, this is a nicer, quicker, more full-featured phone than the 521, and still at a ridiculous price! (Note: I paid $110)","300","Nokia","7"

For the money it has a very good camera, is solidly constructed and works at very fast LTE speeds. But Microsoft seems to have given up on Windows phones, so I can't recommend it. Also, there are far fewer available apps for Windows phones than for Apple or Android phones. Battery life is not great, probably less than most other phones. There have been some other annoying quirks like problems in sending photos or movies by email. To conclude, if you want a low cost phone with good camera and fast LTE speeds, this might be good for you. But if you want access to the full range of apps and an operating system that will be supported for the next few years, I would go with Android or Apple.","300","Nokia","7"

It was great came in a nice nokia box every accesory was original and new. (charger, earphones, battery and battery cover).I decided to buy a new one since I had such a great experience last time so I bought one (blindly and happily) from ROSS CELLULAR died within two days of use. (apparently tailwind international does not have these anymore)For my third try decided to go with BREED and when I tried to charge it nothing happened (did not charge). Tried different methods but nothing worked. So I just sent it back.I bought a third one (same week) from THE WIRELESS CIRCLE. I am really hoping for a better product. Will update review when I receive the phone.I am totally certain that the products I received from BREED and ROSS CELLULAR were not new factory unlocked phones. They were USED/REFURBISHED. The phones came in identical at&t boxes and had aftermarket screen protectors on the screens. The batteries although sealed had charge on them and had scrapes and fingernail scratches. The battery cover also had scrapes and fingernail scratches (even though it came in a fake sealed package). My second phone, from ROSS CELLULAR (the one that didnt charge) came with everything installed on it (I didnt even have to go through the first setup steps, I just powered it on and it went right to the start screen.) NEITHER OF THE TWO HAD ANY ACCESORIES ONLY PHONE & CHARGER. The most curious thing of all is that everything was identical even thought they came from different sellers. (box, fake battery cover, fake screen cover, used battery). Its like someone has a big stockpile of junk cell phones and these sellers just re-sell the junk.So be very careful just your sellers wisely I will update my experience with THE WIRELESS CIRCLE when I get my hopefully new cellphone","300","Nokia","7"

I found things about every one of them that is preferrable to the others. I don't like the fact that this is an unlocked AT&T phone, that should be noted on the product page (not that it's 'factory unlocked').The flow of the OS is quite simple and easy to use, everything is in alphabetical order in the apps list, and the Start screen lets you put whatever apps you want on it and in any order. One weird thing about the 820 (WP8?) is the back arrow vs the Windows button. If you use the Windows button then press the back button it will return to the program you closed (doesn't happen on Android). There are many very useful apps for this OS. Offline maps and translators are quite useful when you're traveling, especially when they're free.The phone itself is nicely designed, simple and clean, and the build quality seems good. The battery cover is a bit difficult to remove (make sure you have everything you want/need to put in when you do this, so it's only required once). The camera is very good and the pictures are clear. For the individual who sat on his phone, it's not shocking at all that it broke, and quite uncertain whether Gorilla Glass would have made a difference.","300","Nokia","7"

"6185","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Black - AT&T - No Warranty","99.98999999999999","5","I am loving my new phone. After much searching, reading reviews and comparison shopping I am glad to end up with the Nokia 820. It generally got good reviews and has not disappointed me in any way after a couple of weeks of use. The one thing the reviews made me worry about was that moving up to this full sized smartphone would seemed like I would be carrying a huge brick, I have found that the Nokia 820 phone fits nicely in my front pocket (I am a blue jeans wearing male) and although it is a little bit heavy in the hand it feels very sturdy and well built and doesn't seem like a burden in the pocket.Naturally I have not completely figured out all of the features of my new phone but I have done my best to get to the ones I anticipate using most often. Music, photos and productivity software all works great on the Nokia. The hardware for taking photos have produced really nice images in a variety of settings and lighting conditions. I haven't printed them out yet but they look good on my desktop screen even when I zoom in on small portions of the picture. The music plays nicely on my headphones and the speaker is acceptable but a little quiet. The loud speaker plays best when placed on a hard surface but if you really want to listen without headphones I recommend getting some external speakers. The music apps preloaded worked great and everything was instantly responsive.This is my first full feature smartphone and so I was not tied into any of the OS ecosystems that are out there. Since I use Microsoft Windows in my work setting it was a relatively easy thing to learn the Windows phone layout. In fact learning new things about my phone has actually increased the usefulness of my home and work computers as I starting syncing more and more of my data across devices. From the productivity standpoint I am now totally sold on the usefulness of this smartphone. I regularly use my e-mail, OneNote and Skydrive accounts throughout my day and have found that the phone seamlessly keeps everything up to date.Speaking of Apps...now I understand why people make such a big deal about the limits of the Windows app store. It isn't like there aren't a ton of apps to choose from but often you start with a web page that you use a lot and then get the mobile app. If that app isn't supported you could go out and find something similar but it just isn't the same. You often have invested time and energy in the original web site and so it feels like a loss to start over with a different app. I don't think this will be a big deal with me but I can see it frustrating people who are more tied to their apps. The phone works great with the apps it has available but you might look to see if your favorite cookbook, movie streaming service or bird app is available for Windows phone if you are choosing which OS you want to live with.Finally and probably most importantly for the supplier of my phone, I would highly recommend purchasing through these guys. They shipped my phone incredibly quickly and provided the exact product described. The unlocked phone naturally comes from overseas and they sent a plug adapter along with it so it was immediately functional. (Quick note: even though my phone was marked for sale in Saudi Arabia, absolutely everything works in good 'ol American English and all the standard apps and features were present from the moment I turned it on.) I had a some questions about the phone and the suppliers replied within half a day if not faster - even on the weekend!","300","Nokia","7"

"6211","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black","95","5","First, a little background, for perspective: I'm an ex-iphone user, migrated from iphone to Android a few years ago, for the freedom and open-ness of the OS. I've really liked the Android OS and the phones I've bought along the way. A few months ago I bought a Lumia 521 with a new Metro PCS account. The Lumia 521 introduced me to Windows 8 Phone OS and I was amazed at how fluid, intuitive and FUN it is - so I decided to fork out for a premium Windows Phone ... which is what brought me to the Lumia 820.The NOKIA LUMIA 820 is SOLID. It's heavy in the hand and has a stable, durable feel to it. The display is vibrant and beautiful. Reviewers and ""experts"" out there on the web can say anything they want about resolution, rag on the pixel density, whatever - but this phone, in your hand is BEAUTIFUL. Colors pop, photos are crisp and videos look great!As was the case with my (brief) experience on the Lumia 521, this is quick, nimble, FAST. Every operation is there when called for, tasks present themselves immediately and close just as quickly. There's something about this Windows OS that must be much less resource-intensive, less hungry than other mobile OS's, because things just pop and fly all over the place.The Tiles ... live tiles, that represent what feels like a living, breathing OS Interface. You see the faces of your contacts and friends rotating in and out of the ""People"" tile ... Facebook posts of friends ""pop up"" in live time, as they are happening ... News updates circulate in a tile, the tile suddenly flips over to reveal another breaking headline ... the tile from your Songza app suddenly flips over to say ""It is Friday Night"" (or late Saturday morning, etc.) ... the Photos tile rotates through your albums, scrolling slowly and continuously ... nothing stands still, this tiled-interface is alive!More on Tiles ... you can size and re-size your tiles, according to taste; regular (square), large (rectangle that covers width of the screen) or small (one quarter size of regular). You can even Pin your favorite websites to the screen, each in a tile of it's own. I've got four favorite Playlists (from Nokia Music) pinned to my screen, each re-sized to small, and they form a little music ""block"", the size of a regular tile!The Lumia 820 has NFC capability and Wireless Charging - something I didn't think I'd ever need or use, but I did fork out for the charging plate and it's been a very nice bonus. I've already grown lazy, with the ability to simply place the phone on it's back for a charge ... no plugs, cables or hassles.CUSTOMIZATION! Unlike other phones in the Lumia lineup, this one has interchangeable back plates. Once in place, it looks like a solid piece of polycarbonate. You can make this a Cyan phone, a bright Red phone, Yellow, White or Black, simply by putting a different (removable) back plate on it. You can order these with or without NFC and Wireless Charging capability. This phone was black when I bought it, I've since changed it to Cyan (and have other colors on order).Is the 920 a better phone? How about the 928? Well, the specs are better on those phones, but for me, this is the sweet spot. It's smaller than the 920, but with the same screen size, and (again), with the joy of body / color customization. Processing speed? System RAM? What are those??? What do I care? When a phone is as fast, fluid, stable and zippy as this is, who cares? When you get a phone that performs as beautifully as this, you can forget about specs (and forget the ""expert"" opinions from the tech sites). None of it matters.Apps ... yes, you hear a lot of whining, complaining, hand-wringing criticism of the Windows app store and it's ""horrible dearth of apps"". If you believe what you read out there on the internet, you probably figure they've got about 10 or 20 apps in the store. I don't know WHO these people are, or WHAT they have on their own phones, but inasmuch as the Windows store has over a hundred thousand apps (126,000 as of last night) ... I feel that is enough for me (and for any reasonable person). Sure, you can bolster your app store to a million, 50 million, a billion, whatever - but when 50,000 of those apps are flashlights (as opposed to one flashlight), how is that improving your app experience?The 8GB of internal space ... once the OS requirements are subtracted, you've got about 5 or 6 gigs to yourself. Unlike it's bigger brethren in the Lumia family, this one comes with a Micro SD slot. I've got a 32GB card in mine, and have set the phone to load all photos, music and videos to the card (rather than to internal storage). That should hold me for awhile.The Camera ... with Carl Zeiss optics and Dual LED Flash, the 8.7 megapixel camera and quality of your photos will be excellent. I've also loaded an HDR app from the store and have experimented with it, garnering some very nice results. I've been taking photos for Instagram, Foodspotting, Facebook and Twitter so far, nothing that requires a critical eye or instrument. I have also set my phone to auto-upload all photos and videos to Skydrive, so I've got an instant backup of everything I've taken.I'm not going to spend any time hashing-out or ""reviewing"" technical details, you'll get plenty of that in other reviews (and websites). Suffice it to say, this is one of the best and THE most enjoyable phone I've ever owned.","300","Nokia","7"

I don't want to pay a high price, but I wanted a newer phone (I was on a cracked Samsung GS for 2 1/2 years). So, getting more tech for less was important and this was the best compromise (1/2 the price of the Samsung GS4 mini and I don't want a billboard in my pocket, ya know).Nokia delivered! They're trying hard to keep up with Google and Apple. WP8 leaves some major gaps, but those will be filled by vendors as the app store develops as well as MS when they mature the OS. Still, I'm pretty blown away with the tech and OS. If it weren't for the lack of apps, I'd never think about going back to Android, but the lack of apps is a headache for WP8. Some minor integration issues that I'm used to (dialing a number and getting a name, for instance) are a problem, but the way WP8 imported all my contacts from the cloud made that tolerable.You can read many more detailed reviews, but from someone who could use Android pretty well and was willing to stay on the leading edge of yesterday with an old, cracked phone that wouldn't die, I will say that WP8 is a nice way to update my tech without paying a lot of money. For the price I paid, I'd do it again, and WP8 is very serviceable. Once the app store starts rolling, Android and iOS may be in for a run. Bottom line: I'm happy with my phone and WP8, I'll definitely keep this set up for a while.Happy Shopping.","300","Nokia","7"

"6236","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black","95","3","UPDATE AUG 2016: A few critical items to add to this review, and this should probably knock the stars down (was 4 stars, May 2016): First, I mentioned that I didn't update the phone to 8.1 and as it turns out this was part of my good luck with this phone. When you do the update, you absolutely lose Internet Sharing. There are some kind of hokey tricks you can find on the net to restore this, and one of these may work, but anyway, this is a massive feature loss. Next is that you cannot update this phone to Windows Phone 10. I still have two of these and partly did the 8.1 update to see how much further it could go. 8.1 is it. You can't go further and apparently it's official from Microsoft now that this phone cannot be upgraded to Windows 10 even though it has plenty memory. Finally, Microsoft in their wisdom removed an app from the store called ""Lumia Storage Check (beta)"" that added a critical capability to this phone: storage of map data for Here Drive/Here Maps on the SD card. Even with Windows Phone 8.0, this app gives a message that ""This app is not available for your device."" It seems Microsoft might have made this app completely non-downloadable with these phones even though you can visit it by direct link (link follows). With this app, you could download maps for entire USA to your SD card and it would cost you about 5 GB. This was awesome, because it meant you could travel anywhere in the US and never need to download maps. It makes the app faster and everything better and *used to be* one of the things I would promote on this phone. So of course, Microsoft killed it, probably because they want the moment by moment data of where you are exactly for marketing reasons. Microsoft has no respect for your privacy and they are as bad as Google. (Link to the app so you can check it yourself:[...]I have purchased *three* of these phones in the last month, and let's start with the bad, but keep reading for the good, and the bad is that God knows where these phones come from, though they *appear to be* more or less new as claimed.So here's the bad. The first phone was a complete dud and had this problem that others had mentioned out here: the phone just would not charge! When I pulled it out of the box and turned it on, all appeared to be OK. But it was like it was ""stupid"" about accepting a charger. Once dead, it never turned back on at all, even sitting on the charger for hours! A very strange thing that I've never seen. The seller, who probably didn't know much more about the oddness of this phone than me, thought it was a bad battery and sent me one of those. With this new battery inserted I was again able to turn the phone on! (Because it had irretrievably died.) But the challenge was keeping it running as it would take something like 10 hours to fully charge! I got a battery monitoring app, and this phone was truly weird, taking enormous amounts of time to charge if it was able to charge at all.Needless to say, this first phone went back.I then purchased another one of these same phones (masochist?) from a different seller (not a masochist?) and perhaps just by dumb luck, I had no problems. The two phones came identically packaged. Both the bad and the ""good"" appeared to be completely new. They were still in shrink-wrap in what appeared to be an original Nokia box. They both had a little identification sticker on the outside of the shrink-wrapped plastic. The only difference was that the first ""bad"" one had no screen protector, and you know, these things always have screen protectors when they're new. Both appeared perfect though and new. Now the bad here from any point of view is that these were both *AT&T* phones that apparently had been somehow unlocked. Both phones (the bad and the good) had the AT&T logo in the upper right corner. Both phones had goofy AT&T apps that I didn't want. Both phones would show the AT&T logo when turning on. (Note that both phones were ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" which is the only way I will generally buy a product on Amazon that is sold by a third party seller and that appears to be ""potentially shady."")My intent was to use these on T-Mobile, so I wasn't too thrilled about the AT&T background. I figured I'd have some weird problems with the phone, even if it appeared to more or less work. So the first feature I tried was the mobile hotspot, because I use that and it's very easy to access on all these Windows Phones. So that worked a treat out of the box and seemed to be a little faster than my old Nokia 4G T-Mobile phone. Anyway, it was pretty much to me blazing fast for a cell phone hotspot, at about 4000 Mbits/sec.So that was great. And the phone seemed to work just fine on T-mobile without any issues with texting or with voicemail, etc. But I thought that too soon because there was one issue, and that was with sending pictures in text messages. I noticed this only after a couple weeks with the phone when I needed to do this. It flat out didn't work. I would send the message and like 5 minutes later I'd get a message from the phone that the message could not be sent. The fix for this was to set the APNs of both ""internet"" and ""mms"" (in Settings:cellular:""edit internet/mms apn""). After that all was well with texting.So, it's now about a month later, and this second phone has had no battery issues whatsoever. It seems to charge completely normally and it takes almost precisely 1.5 hours from dead to full charge. As I mentioned I have a battery monitoring app and it is quite nice and tells me exact info on these things. (""Battery Sense"" is the name of the app and I'd strongly recommend it, though it has ads.)The battery life when the phone is on is not spectacular, but previously I had a definitely brand new and ""unshady"" Nokia 521 and its battery life was none too fantastic either, and overall this phone I would say is about the same. The crazy bright screen on this phone which cannot be dimmed much is probably a big reason the thing sucks down juice quickly when being used, because it does seem to run down more quickly when it's doing something I would say, but when not much is going on with the phone, the steady drain seems normal and if I'm not using it as a hotspot during the day or doing a long video, it should make it through the day fine. I would say for sure it has to be put on the charger every night though.So I bought a second phone from the second seller (making three Nokia 820s total, the first from the other seller) and that one too has not had battery issues (knock wood). It charges normally and has normal battery life and everything seems OK.So I have to say I really like this phone except for the stupidly bright (and battery draining) screen and it seems like a very nice upgrade over my Nokia 521. This phone fills the gaps that the 521 had, like the 521 having no flash.I have always had smartphones with a flash, so it was a little irritation with the 521 to not have that. Now I have a flash again, and it's been great, particularly as a flashlight which is probably the main purpose of a flash on these phones. And this phone has a great flash that also enhances the pictures, more than I would expect of a cheap LED flash. Pictures are great on this phone, as I think they tend to be on this vintage of Nokias. This one seems to have an upgraded camera as well over the 521 and it is very nice. The 521 has an amazing camera for its price, and takes quite nice video again for the price, and so this phone does that and does it better. The flash really seems to improve picture quality more than I would have expected and the pictures have a really tightly focused and nicely lit and color balanced quality. The flash particularly helps I think because the phone uses the flash to figure out exposure settings even when you have the flash turned off and that seems to work fantastically. For example, close-ups with this phone come out great. So this phone is much better than the 521 camera-wise and the 521 as I say was very good.There's also a front facing camera which honestly I don't use much but I know to lots of people this is a key feature.The major big upgrade with this phone is speed though as it is observably faster than the 521, and I'm talking about user interface responsiveness and such. With the 521 I wrote a review saying that the Windows 8.1 upgrade was *not good* partly due to the slow-down. With this phone I can tell that that would be less of a concern, but still I am not upgrading to 8.1 as I particularly don't like the ""androidization"" of the top of the screen and I also don't like that stupid and overdone Cortana thing as it's a dumb form of Siri imitation and it *makes things take longer.* This phone still has that same female voice, but it's not irritating and making everything slower and it's not in your face with its clever ""personality."" It just works and shuts the hell up as much as possible which is how it should be.Anyway, back to performance, the huge selling point of this phone has to do indirectly you might say with speed, and it's the 1 GB RAM versus the Nokia 521's 512 MB RAM. So this phone doubles the RAM, and RAM is a critical need on these phones, especially when you're talking about potentially doing the updates.So even though there was the initial problem with one of these, I really like this phone and the main bad feature is the stupidly bright screen, which contributes to the other bad feature which is the battery life not being a huge improvement over the 521 I previously had. Note that every iPhone out there allows you to dim the hell out of the screen *out of the box* - no app needed! This feature is sometimes a critical need when you are somewhere where you cannot charge and need to conserve juice at all costs! This is not an ""optional"" feature on a cell phone but a must have! Let us turn down the stupid screen ffs!So that's the massive bad feature in this phone which was not a problem on the 521. The 521 has the same limited settings but has a fairly dim screen at the lowest settings. But all in all, this is a nicer, quicker, more full-featured phone than the 521, and still at a ridiculous price! (Note: I paid $110)","300","Nokia","7"

Also, there are far fewer available apps for Windows phones than for Apple or Android phones. Battery life is not great, probably less than most other phones. There have been some other annoying quirks like problems in sending photos or movies by email. To conclude, if you want a low cost phone with good camera and fast LTE speeds, this might be good for you. But if you want access to the full range of apps and an operating system that will be supported for the next few years, I would go with Android or Apple.","300","Nokia","7"

I found things about every one of them that is preferrable to the others. I don't like the fact that this is an unlocked AT&T phone, that should be noted on the product page (not that it's 'factory unlocked').The flow of the OS is quite simple and easy to use, everything is in alphabetical order in the apps list, and the Start screen lets you put whatever apps you want on it and in any order. One weird thing about the 820 (WP8?) is the back arrow vs the Windows button. If you use the Windows button then press the back button it will return to the program you closed (doesn't happen on Android). There are many very useful apps for this OS. Offline maps and translators are quite useful when you're traveling, especially when they're free.The phone itself is nicely designed, simple and clean, and the build quality seems good. The battery cover is a bit difficult to remove (make sure you have everything you want/need to put in when you do this, so it's only required once). The camera is very good and the pictures are clear. For the individual who sat on his phone, it's not shocking at all that it broke, and quite uncertain whether Gorilla Glass would have made a difference.","300","Nokia","7"

"6255","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black","95","5","I am loving my new phone. After much searching, reading reviews and comparison shopping I am glad to end up with the Nokia 820. It generally got good reviews and has not disappointed me in any way after a couple of weeks of use. The one thing the reviews made me worry about was that moving up to this full sized smartphone would seemed like I would be carrying a huge brick, I have found that the Nokia 820 phone fits nicely in my front pocket (I am a blue jeans wearing male) and although it is a little bit heavy in the hand it feels very sturdy and well built and doesn't seem like a burden in the pocket.Naturally I have not completely figured out all of the features of my new phone but I have done my best to get to the ones I anticipate using most often. Music, photos and productivity software all works great on the Nokia. The hardware for taking photos have produced really nice images in a variety of settings and lighting conditions. I haven't printed them out yet but they look good on my desktop screen even when I zoom in on small portions of the picture. The music plays nicely on my headphones and the speaker is acceptable but a little quiet. The loud speaker plays best when placed on a hard surface but if you really want to listen without headphones I recommend getting some external speakers. The music apps preloaded worked great and everything was instantly responsive.This is my first full feature smartphone and so I was not tied into any of the OS ecosystems that are out there. Since I use Microsoft Windows in my work setting it was a relatively easy thing to learn the Windows phone layout. In fact learning new things about my phone has actually increased the usefulness of my home and work computers as I starting syncing more and more of my data across devices. From the productivity standpoint I am now totally sold on the usefulness of this smartphone. I regularly use my e-mail, OneNote and Skydrive accounts throughout my day and have found that the phone seamlessly keeps everything up to date.Speaking of Apps...now I understand why people make such a big deal about the limits of the Windows app store. It isn't like there aren't a ton of apps to choose from but often you start with a web page that you use a lot and then get the mobile app. If that app isn't supported you could go out and find something similar but it just isn't the same. You often have invested time and energy in the original web site and so it feels like a loss to start over with a different app. I don't think this will be a big deal with me but I can see it frustrating people who are more tied to their apps. The phone works great with the apps it has available but you might look to see if your favorite cookbook, movie streaming service or bird app is available for Windows phone if you are choosing which OS you want to live with.Finally and probably most importantly for the supplier of my phone, I would highly recommend purchasing through these guys. They shipped my phone incredibly quickly and provided the exact product described. The unlocked phone naturally comes from overseas and they sent a plug adapter along with it so it was immediately functional. (Quick note: even though my phone was marked for sale in Saudi Arabia, absolutely everything works in good 'ol American English and all the standard apps and features were present from the moment I turned it on.) I had a some questions about the phone and the suppliers replied within half a day if not faster - even on the weekend!","300","Nokia","7"

"6257","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black","95","4","The Good:The display is really great and vivid. Even though the display isn't HD it still looks great. The build is really nice, it's a bit heavy but you get used to it. UI is super snappy and fast. I've been very happy with it. Camera isn't the greatest I've seen but it is definitely more than sufficient for the price.The Bad:The back is really slippery to hold unless your hands are sweaty. Will probably need a case to accompany it. But, the only real con to this phone is that the signal/antenna is a bit weaker than other phones I've tried. I have a weak signal in my house but most phones I've had (I try lots of them) would at least stay connected to the network. The 820 showed ""no service"" a little too often. Something to be aware of.","300","Nokia","7"

I decided to get the same thing, so we could learn together. I'm totally happy with it, and a bonus is that my husband can see the screen without his reading glasses and it does just about anything he wants it to do...plus I've got apps to make my life easier.

"6283","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black","95","4","this is my intro to WP8 so everything is different.CONs- Nokia suit does not work with WP8 so i could not import my contacts. which means i now have to type them in 1 by 1. if i get a work around for this i'll post an update.- No FM Radio. the specs say radio but there's no radio. according to what I've been reading Nokia's hardware will do radio but Windows drop the ball on the software. Some folks are hopeful that Windows will make an update to fix that but this phone has been out long enough for them to have fixed this by now so i don't think its a priority for them. Surprisingly i got a streaming radio app from the windows store (tunein) and it has my local stations. Suppressing because i'm from St. Lucia (in the Caribbean) where no one heard of. so if my local stations are there yours probably is too. the problem with this is you need wifi for this, which means the quality is poor depending on your connection and if i had to use a data plan for this it would get too expensive for free radio.- SD card slot is under the battery. my thoughts are that an SD memory card should have quick access without having to turn your phone off. With this phone you have to turn the phone, remove the cover and battery to get to the card.- the battery life is exactly as many reviews say. it sucks. i have to charge this phone EVERYDAY. if you get this phone my advise is to get extra chargers; have one at work, at home, in the car, at moms house... cause you'll need it. the good thing is the phone does not take long to charge. but truth be told most smart phones today have this issue. You have to keep them plugged in (and that does not hurt the battery by-the-way).i know i went on a bit about the radio and nokia suit thing but those were selling points for me. i first gave this 2 stars because of this but i reconsidered because the phone is a good phone. if you're going to advertise something and not deliver that will not make me buy from you in the future. Nokia suit was a big selling point for me because i have hundreds of contacts and having to re-enter them 1 by 1 every time i get a new phone is a pain. for this alone i no longer have any reason to have any brand loyalty to Nokia.if i could push myself past these 2 sticking points, i actually like this phone. its not as big as the GS3. it fits in my packet and hand easily. the touch screen is responsive. the camera is great. You can customize the tiles and there are plenty of apps to do whatever you want.I will love this phone for as long as it last (hoping for 2 years, any longer is a bonus). But if i had to do it over i would consider the Lumia 625... because it has radio.ps/ Turns out WP8 has podcasts. which is the only reason i have an ipod. so now i only carry one device.Update: 16/Jan/14- Now with radio. YAAH! after an update last night i now have FM radio. Happy Day. Now bumped to 4 stars.","300","Nokia","7"

First thing I did was upgrade to wp 8.1 (8 is a great OS, but 8.1 has Cortana and a couple of other great features). This phone is fast, smooth gets great reception and has a surprisingly brilliant display (based on the lower resolution). Front facing camera is kind of horrible, however I'm not someone that takes ""selfies"" anyway, so I never use it.I would DEFINITLY suggest at least a 32 gb micro-SD card.I am using this phone with Straight Talk and it ported easily to them with no problems at all.***EDIT***Just a word of warning, and this is totally my fault and not the fault of the phone. Get a case for this phone. My father is dying of cancer and is on hospice, so I am under stress. That being the case I dropped the phone. The phone still works great, however because of the camera design it is half loosened and the flash no longer works.

"6310","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black","95","1","The Hardware==============Call Quality - Excellent (Typical of all Nokia Phones)The Build Quality - Excellent (Typical of all Nokia Phones)The screen - Good, vibrant, scratch resistant and repels facial grease, IS NOT GORILLA GLASS and is noticeably more fragile.Loudspeaker - A little on the soft sideThe Software==============I have been an avid Windows user since Windows 98, and a Windows Phone user since Windows Phone 7.Windows over the years has gotten more capable and much faster with time. Windows XP to Vista was a little buggy but it worked. Windows Vista to 7 was just a case of slothering Vista in butter and polishing it up to a fine sheen.Windows Phone 7 to Windows Phone 8 has been the experience nightmares are made of. It was basically going from Windows 7 to Windows 95.Windows Phone 7 was an elegant experience for me minus some minor quirks here and there. The most noticeable one was the inability to assign more than one mobile number to any one contact which was rather odd. Others were like not being able to multiselect files or difficulty putting ringtones and audiobooks on the device.They weren't deal breakers and there were some workarounds. That said, everything else in the OS was fully functional. The phones available has very limited storage, most maxing out at 16gbs. However as many figured out, the 1st generation WP7 devices uses MicroSD cards in place of soldered in onboard memory and with a little trick and the right SD Card, could take a 8gb phone and transform it into a 32gb phone. I did it with no problems on my 8gb Dell Venue Pro. Even better, integration with the Zune Desktop Software (ZDS) made syncing music, pictures, podcasts and videos to a lesser extent, a breeze.When i got home, I put my phone to charge, it would ping my desktop wirelessly, fire up the ZDS and start syncing my new podcasts and music automatically to my phone. When I left for work the next morning, everything just worked.Window Phone 8 is nothing like that. With this new OS, expandable storage is natively supported except on my Lumia 820 it doesn't work at all. When i put in my Sandisk 64gb MicroSDXC card, and fired up Windows Media Player to Sync my playlists as I did with my Zune and Windows Phones on the ZDS. (I did this with my old sandisk E250 player back in the PlayForSure days as well)My first thought, ""Wow this is slow!!""Second thought, ""why is song taking to long to transfer?""10 minutes later ""why is the same song still transferring""30 minutes later ""oh *uck it froze""Then something that never happened on my WP7 Dell Venue Pro happened, my Music and Video app crashed, so did my settings app. On shutting it down, it was permanently frozen on the goodbye screen.I forced restarted it by removing the battery.When i powered it up, the SD Card was missing... I turned off the phone, removed the card and put it back in, powered the phone on and it was still missing. I took the card out and put it in a card reader on the PC. The disc check utility detected an inconsistency on the Card and ran but found no errors. Once it was back in the phone, the phone saw it once more. I tried syncing a playlist again, it transferred on playlist and froze in the middle of another.This happened over and over. Then I quick formatted the card back in exfat on my PC and tried syncing playlists directly to the card without the phone between them. Every song synced perfectly.Once back in my phone, all the songs turned up but... for some odd reason, some songs would turn up with no artist or album information. If i resynced them, or copied them manually, they would then show with the correct info, but then other songs would start doing the same thing, to no fault of the songs themselves because they all worked fine on my Zunes and DVP.Using explorer to drag and drop lots of small numerous files, music and pics mainly, always results in some sort of freezing during copying.In the end I gave up although I was able to do some podcast subscriptions directly on my phone by changing my country to USA so I could have some sort of entertainment on my phone for when I was driving or waiting in line. This is still a problem because when I want to view podcasts on my TV or desktop while I work with my nice sounding speakers... I can't.Over the last 2 days something else has started happening which is doubly annoying. For some odd reason, my music videos and pictures have started duplicating and triplicating themselves.If i plug in the phone and navigate to the directory, there is only one physical file even thought the phone sees 2 or 3 of them.Whats worse is if I delete even one of the duplicates, all of the duplicates including the original are deleted.The Nokia Lumia 820 is a horrible phone===========================================This is coming from someone who has owned only Nokia phones his whole life aside for a Dell Venue Pro and an Ericsson and has been a massive fan of Microsoft's Zune Software and Hardware devices as well as the Windows Phone 7 line of devices.NOTHING works like it ought to and despite how much I loved WP7, I cannot recommend this phone to anyone out there.I cannot even return it for a refund because it was bought in the USA and I live in Trinidad and Tobago.If other Windows Phone 8 handsets give the same problem as this Lumia 820, I recommend avoiding them until Microsoft and the OEM's get their house in order and fix what was not broken in Windows Phone 7.5 to begin with.","300","Nokia","7"

"6312","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black","95","4","I have a Nokia N8 that I wanted to upgrade and since Nokia's build quality speaks for itself I went for a Lumia.I wanted a phone with expandable memory as my music and photos are on the MicroSD card and I also wanted a phone with at least 1GB of RAM.So I got this Lumia 820.So far the phone has been great, save for some basic features I really miss like FM Radio, Flip to Silence, select a custom message alert, the ability to set separate volume for alarms, music, ringtones, etc., notification center, some kind of visual alert that I have missed a call, alert or a sms so I don't have to turn the screen on to check, have the phone ring and vibrate at the same time, and some other things I already have on a 3 years old phone but missing on a phone launched 5 months ago.The battery life is not as great as with the N8 but then again it's a 680 MHz 3.5 inches vs a 1.5GHz Dual Core 4.3 inches phone.I'm liking the phone so far as the UI is very fast but untill I get back all the funtionality I now have on my 3 years old Symbian phone, the N8 will stay with me as my primary phone. Maybe I can retire it for an Android phone as it has nearly all the features and functionality Symbian has.","300","Nokia","7"

"6314","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black","95","5","The Nokia Lumia 820 is an interesting smartphone - it does well in some things, but falters in others. To be more specific, we like its solid build quality and its overall size and feel. The hardware is also good, while the Nokia-branded apps, especially Maps and Drive+ are major differentiators.However, the weak camera and poor call quality are major flaws, which cannot be understated. If these aren't that much of deal-breakers for you, then we see no reason not to recommend the 820, but if you're looking for a well-balanced and all-round solid performer, better start thinking about something better, like the Lumia 920.please visit [...]","300","Nokia","7"

They arrived promptly, but the sealing sticker for each of the boxes was broken, and one of the phones had an old (Verizon) SIM card in it, so it had clearly been used before. Also, it wasn't mentioned anywhere in the product description, but the phones seem to be intended for use in Mexico. They work in the US because GSM is an international standard, but all of the documentation and user manuals are in Spanish only. When you do a factory reset on the phone, it defaults to Spanish as well. So to summarize: the phone I got was used, and none of the documentation is in English.The phone itself seems like a good product, but I would not buy from this seller again (Voltage Converter Store).","300","Nokia","7"

Even that would've been okay if the phone was indeed unlocked as the seller claims, however the phone I received was not. I paid for an unlocked phone but got a LOCKED phone.

There are some useful 'live tiles' and many good apps but I am amazed there is not a decent clock/ alarm live tile.The phone is very solid, a little heavy but I like the heft. The screen is bright but not as bright as most Samsungs or the Moto X I bought at the same time. I really like the Moto X! Also the screen is smaller than many phones now offered. The camera takes good pictures which was a selling point. I was able to upload pics directly to Onedrive then use them in a classified ad uploaded from my desktop. While not a unique capability it worked well.This phone has 4G which was a must - many phones in its price range did not. But since I bought this the newer Lumia 625 has come down in price.

Then the flash on this phone did not work, probably caused it's a used phone and the feature might have been broken. Returned this phone and got one from a different store.","300","Nokia","7"
"6358","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black","95","5","As background - I previously had a Lumia 521 and it met all my needs - which are mainly texting, an occasional phone call, checking emails, and every once in awhile checking something on the internet. The phone started to overheat to the point I feared my house might burn down one night, and when I couldn't get another Lumia 521 I figured I would maybe make the switch to an android to take advantage of all the apps that are made for android and iphone users which never seem to cover Windows. I have a Samsung Galaxy Player for listening to music and found a Samsung Avant phone that was a good size to fit in my pocket, so figured I would ""upgrade"". What a mistake. That phone was so frustrating. Because my Lumia 521 was ""cheap"" I had been fooled into thinking it was not as good a phone - but it turned out it was actually better. I am not one to quickly replace a phone, but after a month of frustration I couldn't stand it and researched to see what would be a good Nokia phone that might be a good size to fit in my pocket with a slightly better camera than the 521. After careful research I settled on the 820 and so far am pretty glad I did. It is not perfect, but it meets most of my checklist and all of my high priority items. First - I have difficulties getting phones, tablets, etc.. to respond to my touch. Apparently my fingers just aren't recognized. So with the Samsung I would have to swipe 3 or 4 times to get it to work. With the Lumia's it recognizes my touch -every time. I have seen demonstrations of people using them with gloves and they work fine. So whatever that technology might be - it is a great feature and number one in reducing my frustrations. Second, they have a great texting autocorrect. Once you learn to just plow ahead with your incorrect spelling and have faith that one second later the autocorrect will fix it to the right word, you will be in heaven. With the Samsung, the autocorrect was nightmarish. I would have the whole word correct except perhaps the last letter. The Samsung autocorrect would split what I had typed into 3 nonsensical separate words. The time it would take to fix the autocorrect was not worth it and I had to turn it off. Third, I like a microSD card option. The 820 allows for a microSD card - so I know that I can save my pictures, etc., and easily be able to download them or transfer, etc.. The Windows account already backs them up, but it is nice to know that I can have all this extra memory AND just move the card over to a new phone, etc.. Plus, I figure if I do something stupid to my phone, as long as the SD card doesn't get crushed and I can get it out, then I can save all my photos. Fourth, there is a replaceable battery. I cannot understand a phone that wouldn't let you change the battery for a new one once it starts to fail. Fifth, the navigation. The Windows navigation just makes so much more sense. With my Samsung, my teenage daughters would be asking me how to get back to a previous text, etc.. You know a phone is counter intuitive when a teenager needs help using it. I would like to additionally have got a much better camera, but so far the pictures I have taken are just as crummy as the ones on the 521. I now have a flash, which is a good thing, but the camera is still not great. Probably my main knock against it. Another requirement I had is a phone approximately the size of an iPhone so that I can fit it in my pocket. This phone is a really nice size so it scores high for its nice size. If you've never used a windows phone you'll fine the tiles are a really nice feature - I really missed them when I had the Samsung phone. One thing you'll want to keep in mind - and this could be important - is that the phone I got is an AT&T phone. I use T-mobile so this was both good and bad. It was good because for some reason unknown to me, but which I had stumbled upon during my research, only the AT&T branded phones are able to upgrade to Windows 8.1 which has Cortana. The T-Mobile phones are not allowed to upgrade. Apparently upgrades are actually at the discretion of the carrier, and T-mobile doesn't allow it on this phone. So what I did was when I first got the phone, I started it up without a SIM card in it and connected to the wifi. After being connected a little while to the wifi it told me there was an update to 8.1 available for my phone. So I updated it while it thought it was AT&T. I then had to get online and request the unlock code from AT&T . It was easy enough to do and I got the code pretty much right away (it gives you a link to check the status of your request, so I checked that link immediately and my code was right there). However, it does say it could take several days (I think it said up to 5 days) so if you are planning to use your phone right away on T-mobile and AT&T decides to take a long time to give you the unlock code you may be out of luck. So you would think all is well and good but then I realized - and researched - that because this is an AT&T branded phone, I could not get the T-mobile function of making calls over wifi. Apparently that function is a T-mobile specific function that only comes on T-mobile phones. Because I really have only used that function once in the last year, I would rather have Windows 8.1 and Cortana, so I am just as happy that this is an AT&T phone. But you'll have to decide for yourself if that is a problem or not. There may be some other T-Mobile specific functionality that I am now missing but so far I have not stumbled on any. Now I just hope that this one doesn't overheat like my 521 did, because I plan to keep this phone for a good long time.","300","Nokia","7"

It was great came in a nice nokia box every accesory was original and new. (charger, earphones, battery and battery cover).I decided to buy a new one since I had such a great experience last time so I bought one (blindly and happily) from ROSS CELLULAR died within two days of use. (apparently tailwind international does not have these anymore)For my third try decided to go with BREED and when I tried to charge it nothing happened (did not charge). Tried different methods but nothing worked. So I just sent it back.I bought a third one (same week) from THE WIRELESS CIRCLE. I am really hoping for a better product. Will update review when I receive the phone.I am totally certain that the products I received from BREED and ROSS CELLULAR were not new factory unlocked phones. They were USED/REFURBISHED. The phones came in identical at&t boxes and had aftermarket screen protectors on the screens. The batteries although sealed had charge on them and had scrapes and fingernail scratches. The battery cover also had scrapes and fingernail scratches (even though it came in a fake sealed package). My second phone, from ROSS CELLULAR (the one that didnt charge) came with everything installed on it (I didnt even have to go through the first setup steps, I just powered it on and it went right to the start screen.) NEITHER OF THE TWO HAD ANY ACCESORIES ONLY PHONE & CHARGER. The most curious thing of all is that everything was identical even thought they came from different sellers. (box, fake battery cover, fake screen cover, used battery). Its like someone has a big stockpile of junk cell phones and these sellers just re-sell the junk.So be very careful just your sellers wisely I will update my experience with THE WIRELESS CIRCLE when I get my hopefully new cellphone","300","Nokia","7"

It's been six months and the phone has been working fine. So based on my experience, I will definitely recommend it.","300","Nokia","7"

"6385","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black","95","5","Phone came in the original AT&T box and in great condition as stated. It says it is unlocked, but doesn't work for Sprint. It works perfectly for T-Mobile though. Before this phone, I used a T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G, a first generation android. That was small 3' or so and very light. I wasn't looking for the latest smartphone (iPhone), but something affordable and efficient for basic functions. This phone is it. It's 4'3"" and heavier, but it fits well since I easily drop my phone. It operates on Windows 8 and contains features and apps that are easily accessible and easy to use, such as Facebook, Twitter, Nokia Maps, etc. It has an 8-megapixel rear camera, but a very bad front camera, 0.3 megapixel. Hence, it's decent camera quality. I am a tad sad that I can't take good ""selfies."" Since I use my phone moderately and its functions, its battery life lasts long, though I've only had it for about 3 weeks. Good performance overall and fast connection Internet with 4G.","300","Nokia","7"

I contacted Ross Cellular on this, they replied that this model is AT&T branded, so you will have all those apps.Even though it worked with different carrier (tried T-Mobile), but if you are really looking for an unlocked phone don't get this model. And more over, the bundle did not have headphone, the charger and the user manual looked cheap, i guess they are not the real Nokia ones.","300","Nokia","7"
"6416","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black","95","3","First of all, I bought two Nokia L820 from Blutekusa (fulfillment by Amazon) as new factory unlocked 4G LTE penta bands: (800/900/1800/2100/2600 MHz), however I received 2 AT&T unlocked Lumia 820 (Variant RM-824) which is a dual band LTE (1700/700 MHz) with no standard accessories (Nokia AC-50U MicroUSB Charger, Nokia Charging and Data Cable (CA-190CD)) or earphones. I received a no brand generic Chinese charger that it is not able to remain attached to the cell phone during charging because of the weakness of its attachment clips at the micro usb connector. Everybody knows that AT&T devices never come factory unlocked, they are exclusively manufactured for its network, so these Cells are not new they were refurbished to be unlocked. Moreover, I think that the back shell is not original because it arrived with a little dent in one of its corners and with no brand (Nokia/AT&T) or parte number it is completely flat (inside and outside) and is so weak that I damaged a corner with the nail trying to remove the shell to install the battery. I was able to update the OS to WP Amber and it works really fast.As you can see on previous reviews Nokia L820 is a really good cell phone (a little giant but not excellent) with fluent WP8 but with really two big sins: the 1650mAh Battery is too little for all things that you can do with this cell phone and the lacking of gorilla glass.","300","Nokia","7"
"6417","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black","95","3","I bought this phone less than a month ago. I was very happy so far, however I realized that camera is not stable on the back. One side have higher elevation and I had to push it and tape it, My suggestion for people who wants to buy this phone is to but a protective cover which covers around camera and help it to be stable.It was also not mentioned on the ad but the phone was at&t unlocked phone. Every time you turn it on, you will see the logo of the at&t and I was reading that only way to get rid of it was to reset the phone. But I am kinda afraid of doing reset since it may cause to disappear some of the apps already there.If I had not realized the camera problem, the phone could be awesome.","300","Nokia","7"

"6426","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black","95","4","I've been using a small Sony Xperia X8(android) for 2 years so I decided to give this Nokia a try.I've always been pro-Windows so I decided to buy this phone because it was now cheap, even though it was released like 2 years ago.I bought it Unblocked on April 2014, from ABCellPROS:- Overall quality is very good. Nokia never lets me down.- Wireless tethering(Internet sharing) thats good!!- I can choose to navigate pages as a desktop browser and not as a mobile browser which has some restrictions by some sites. (Update 2014-Oct: Not anymore with the latests updates)- It has mini versions of Word and Excel included.- The main icons screen is very easy to use and to manage.- Video playback is smooth and looks good.- The file structure of the SD card is very simple, not like Androids which is filled with dozens of folders.- Good cameraCONS:- The battery life is bad, but since mine is a used one I can not say if the new ones are better.- Not so good MP3 player. Too confusing. I just needed a simple player.- Bad MP3s codecs, could not play some of my 320Kbps songs, like my Sony Xperia X8 did easily. However an app called Pocket File Manager did play these songs well, I did not expect that from a file management app.- The flashlight is not full white, it has like some kind of warmth in it, so some photos might look warm(yellowish).- One of the three main buttons is dedicated entirely to Bing search. I don't like Bing, so for me it is a big waste of a button that could have been useful for any other function. (Update 2014-Aug: the WP 8.1 Update changed this to Cortana a voice assistant. Nice!!)- Very grainy photos in low light when flash is not used.- On the internet browser, part of the screen (like 15% I guess) is wasted displaying the URL the whole time. (Update 2014-Aug: I installed another browser)- No ""forward"" button or feature on the internet browser. (Update 2014-Aug: the WP 8.1 Update added this feature)- No OTG. OTG lets you connect keyboard, mouse, flash memory and other USB devices to the phone.- I can not organize my photos and images in custom albums.FINAL THOUGHTS:Even though the phone has almost everything I need, it always leaves me the feeling that I'm isolated( or imcompatible) from the Android population. The grass is greener....Unless Microsoft make some huge improvements on these phones in the near future, I think that I'll eventually go back to Android sooner or later.2014-Aug-13 UPDATE:- I'm not missing Android that much as I thought I was going to be.- Sadly the headphone jack has stopped working, it seems like is an issue that a lot of people is having according to what I have read on the internet.- Still satisfied with this phone.2014-Oct-15 UPDATE:- Suddenly the headphone jack started to work again. I think because of the latest updates. So I guess it was a software problem.- The battery life is starting to upset me. It only lasts a few hours when connected phone company network.- The assistant Cortana is looking very helpful, unfortunately only works when there's internet.May 2015 - Final Update:- The headphone jack broke again. I don't know if it is a hardware or software problem.- With the accumulation of photos I needed a folder feature in photos which it never came with updates.I finally gave up and bought a Samsung Galaxy K Zoom. It has a decent battery, photos that can be organized in folders, OTG, etcI still love Nokia, and expect to go back someday when they have a better device.Thanks for reading.","300","Nokia","7"

"6443","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black","95","5","I don't take a lot of pictures and I don't need my phone to work like my tablet. I wanted a sturdy phone with expandable storage that ran the Windows OS. That is what I got with this phone. It's pretty much the perfect size for my hand, not too thick, but doesn't feel cheap. That back pops off and the battery is removable, another plus that I wasn't even looking for. The wireless charging cases are pretty cheap ($15 off at&t website) so I'll be getting one of those soon, the charging plate is probably a little more expensive though. A protective case fits right over the removable back and can reportedly be charged wirelessly through it. (For those that don't know, the back of this phone is removable, that's where the wireless charging case goes. A protective cover can go on top of that for even more durability). The sound quality isn't the best I've ever had, but then again I don't really like talking on the phone in the first place, so this gives me an excuse when my wife is chattering on and on and on. And on and on. And on again. Hmm...I hope she never sees this review...Anywho, I digress....this phone is exactly what I was looking for. Not too fancy, will most likely last me more than the 2-year contract that I'm used to with smart phones. I like it much better than my previous HTC Windows 8X which felt cheap and had only 8GB of memory. Both are better than my previous Android phone as I much prefer the Windows OS.","300","Nokia","7"

Has a aftermarket back cover there was no NOKIA logo on it. The screen and lens have a plastic cover on top. Which makes the outside look deceivingly new.- Updated the phone to latest Windows 8.1 took 6 hours and 5 updates to move to latest version. WP 8.1 is much better compared to WP 8 looks good.

Coming from Android, there was a little learning curve, but it was pretty ease to figure it out and teach her how to use it. The one thing that was really a pain is that the firmware (operating system) on it is really out of date and some of the features of the device will not work until you update it to the latest firmware release. This would not be a problem, but you have to update it in multiple steps, and each steps takes about an hour. But once you get it fully updated, it seems to work fine. She has had very little problem with except for it not wanting to let her send pictures through text. Not sure what the problem is there. It might be the phone or a compatibility issue with AT&T. I will update this review when I figure it out.","300","Nokia","7"

I researched a lot before buying it, and I'm happy with it!At first, I was surprised because it came with Italian factory settings (language and manual), but it was easy to change to my language.The battery life is satisfactory. If used mostly of the day with functions Wi-Fi and GPS on, the cell phone lasts for approximately a day and half without recharging. Without these functions, it lasts about three days.Windows 8 is easy and fun to use, although it has fewer applications available in their store than Android.The camera has a great quality compared to the standard camera phones.For me, a great quality of the phone is its GPS. Nokia Maps with its function to work offline is perfect, and the location occurs rapidly. Nokia Drive works as a perfect automotive GPS with voice options in several languages​​.In summary, I'm happy with the phone and I recommend it!","300","Nokia","7"

"6471","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black","95","5","I bought this as a trial, I've used BB7, BB10, Android, and now WP8. I found things about every one of them that is preferrable to the others. I don't like the fact that this is an unlocked AT&T phone, that should be noted on the product page (not that it's 'factory unlocked').The flow of the OS is quite simple and easy to use, everything is in alphabetical order in the apps list, and the Start screen lets you put whatever apps you want on it and in any order. One weird thing about the 820 (WP8?) is the back arrow vs the Windows button. If you use the Windows button then press the back button it will return to the program you closed (doesn't happen on Android). There are many very useful apps for this OS. Offline maps and translators are quite useful when you're traveling, especially when they're free.The phone itself is nicely designed, simple and clean, and the build quality seems good. The battery cover is a bit difficult to remove (make sure you have everything you want/need to put in when you do this, so it's only required once). The camera is very good and the pictures are clear. For the individual who sat on his phone, it's not shocking at all that it broke, and quite uncertain whether Gorilla Glass would have made a difference.","300","Nokia","7"

"6475","Nokia Lumia 820 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black","95","5","I am loving my new phone. After much searching, reading reviews and comparison shopping I am glad to end up with the Nokia 820. It generally got good reviews and has not disappointed me in any way after a couple of weeks of use. The one thing the reviews made me worry about was that moving up to this full sized smartphone would seemed like I would be carrying a huge brick, I have found that the Nokia 820 phone fits nicely in my front pocket (I am a blue jeans wearing male) and although it is a little bit heavy in the hand it feels very sturdy and well built and doesn't seem like a burden in the pocket.Naturally I have not completely figured out all of the features of my new phone but I have done my best to get to the ones I anticipate using most often. Music, photos and productivity software all works great on the Nokia. The hardware for taking photos have produced really nice images in a variety of settings and lighting conditions. I haven't printed them out yet but they look good on my desktop screen even when I zoom in on small portions of the picture. The music plays nicely on my headphones and the speaker is acceptable but a little quiet. The loud speaker plays best when placed on a hard surface but if you really want to listen without headphones I recommend getting some external speakers. The music apps preloaded worked great and everything was instantly responsive.This is my first full feature smartphone and so I was not tied into any of the OS ecosystems that are out there. Since I use Microsoft Windows in my work setting it was a relatively easy thing to learn the Windows phone layout. In fact learning new things about my phone has actually increased the usefulness of my home and work computers as I starting syncing more and more of my data across devices. From the productivity standpoint I am now totally sold on the usefulness of this smartphone. I regularly use my e-mail, OneNote and Skydrive accounts throughout my day and have found that the phone seamlessly keeps everything up to date.Speaking of Apps...now I understand why people make such a big deal about the limits of the Windows app store. It isn't like there aren't a ton of apps to choose from but often you start with a web page that you use a lot and then get the mobile app. If that app isn't supported you could go out and find something similar but it just isn't the same. You often have invested time and energy in the original web site and so it feels like a loss to start over with a different app. I don't think this will be a big deal with me but I can see it frustrating people who are more tied to their apps. The phone works great with the apps it has available but you might look to see if your favorite cookbook, movie streaming service or bird app is available for Windows phone if you are choosing which OS you want to live with.Finally and probably most importantly for the supplier of my phone, I would highly recommend purchasing through these guys. They shipped my phone incredibly quickly and provided the exact product described. The unlocked phone naturally comes from overseas and they sent a plug adapter along with it so it was immediately functional. (Quick note: even though my phone was marked for sale in Saudi Arabia, absolutely everything works in good 'ol American English and all the standard apps and features were present from the moment I turned it on.) I had a some questions about the phone and the suppliers replied within half a day if not faster - even on the weekend!","300","Nokia","7"

"6530","Samsung 32GB Galaxy Note 10.1"" Android 4G LTE Wi-Fi Dual Camera Unlocked Tablet","499.99","4","The speed of this tablet is unreal! It is by far the fastest I've had my hands on. The UI is very responsive and flows between apps as smooth as butter! I believe the Quadrant score was around 22,000! However, I think mine may be faulty... The battery life is subpar and even my 3 year old Acer A700 has more than twice the run time under the same load. I'm seeing around 4 - 5 hours of actual use before the battery drops below 25 - 30%; below that, it drains very rapidly. That is with 1 - 1.5 hours of games and the remaining time watching movies or web surfing. I'm finding myself having to recharge it at least once during the day, which brings up another complaint. Even with the stock charger, charging is slower than I would expect. If I connect a non OEM power adapter (5v, rather than the 5.3v Samsung adapter), it charges even slower and, should the screen turn off, will stop charging altogether.I've read through XDA and other forums enough to see that others have reported experiencing these issues, but enough have validated that this is not the standard. I've hoped with my battery life would improve after several charging cycles, however, it seems to stay the same. I do believe I'll be exchanging it in the hopes that I get one that performs as it should. All in all, though, I really like the look, feel, and speed of this tablet, but if I can't make it through the day without recharging, which has not been an issue with any of my older tablets, then I may need to keep looking,---- Update: 9/17/15I decided to keep this tablet. With subsequent charging cycles, the battery life began improving and now gets closer to 8 hours of use, which is near what the stated battery time is.I am still deducting a star for 2 reasons though. The T-Mobile chime when it turns on is very LOUD and very ANNOYING! Don't even think about trying to discreetly turn this on or restart it. The other con is that, despite having a Qualcom chipset, Quick Charge 2.0 doesn't seem to be enabled in the firmware. Hopefully that will be fixed in the future. I did purchase this charger [Qualcomm Certified] Anker PowerPort+ 1 (Quick Charge 2.0 and PowerIQ Technology 2-in-1 Premium 18W USB Wall Charger) for Galaxy S6 / Edge / Plus, Note 5 / 4, LG G4, HTC One M8 / M9, Nexus 6 and More and highly recommend it! It charges the tablet as well, if not better, than the OEM charger and, unlike all of my other aftermarket 5v 2+ amp chargers, the Note 10.1 doesn't stop charging if the screen turns off.All in all, I'm happy with this tablet. I do sometimes wonder though if it would have been worth another $150 to get the WIFI only version without the T-Mobile startup chime. :)","178","Samsung","8"

"6558","Samsung 32GB Galaxy Note 10.1"" Android 4G LTE Wi-Fi Dual Camera Unlocked Tablet","499.99","4","So far I am getting to know the Samsung Galaxy Note 2014 and liking the features. The screen is fine and the pen works well.My concern is that the description says that the tablet is 'unlocked' and I recall that information would be included to say how to unlock the tablet. However, the tablet came with a warning on the tape to open the box - if one connects to TMobile, then one agrees to the 1 year contract and terms of service. The first thing that I did was to remove the SIM card. (Note that the SIM card was already installed even though the instructions tell you how to install your SIM card - a bug or a feature?). I was in no way going to be accidentally connected to a server and contract I do not want. The tablet seems to want a sim card, claiming some features are not available. I have not found any information about how to 'unlock' the tablet or to remove the TMobile introduction with their jingle. I am assuming that removing the SIM card is the way to unlock the tablet and if I did want to connect I would purchase some other company SIM card. TMobile may be a nice company but I do not want this tablet connected to a data plan and would like to pass on their sign-in message. Any help on this would be appreciated.","178","Samsung","8"

When buying I wasn't sure about the S pen, whether it was included or not. Fortunately it comes ""embedded"" in the tablet body which is also great for keeping it safe and not running the risk of losing it somewhere. I tried out the handwriting and it's awesome. The screen is very sensitive and the S pen is very precise and easy-going.

Everything I've loaded works great including sidesync, etc. I've had no issues with shutting off or anything. I'm not using the LTE cellular functions yet and battery life has been very good.I researched a long time before deciding to go route and this hardware in early 2016 is still very powerful. I compared the display on this to the tab S2 9.7 and 8.0 and this one has much better color rendition at off center viewing angles. The TAB s2 amoled turns green/blue at a very slight angle. The only upsides to the tab s2 are the higher contrast and lightness of the tablet. Compared to the tab S2 and for a similar price of $420, this older tablet is the way to go.Probably the only downside on this 2014 10.1 is that it will probably no longer see anymore android updates from samsung, but then one can root it down the road and get newer android with cyanogen mod. But by then, hopefully new and improved tablets with pens will be available.EDIT 2016-01-30: Still loving this tablet. To fix the t-mobile boot up sound, look for an app called 'silent boot'.

I was debating between the 8 inch and this, but I'm very glad I got this instead. First off, the tablet would be very different if there was no stylus.

I am a full time faculty member at a university, and I'm also a full-time PhD student. My primary use for this tablet is for reading papers, which is seemingly an interminable task. I use several programs to annotate PDF documents, and highlighting and writing notes on PDF documents are very easy with the S-pen (very accurate). The tablet also picks up the handwriting very well, and for the most part, it accurately converts handwriting to text.Additionally, this tablet is very fast, and since it is a T-mobile tablet, you do get the free 200 mb data per month, provided that you sign up.

I have the first edition Galaxy Note 10.1 and wanted something with higher screen resolution and the ability to take a SIM card for my Consumer Cellular mobile phone service so I can retrieve email messages while away from home. This also makes it useful as a navigation device using Google Maps. My aging eyes had trouble focusing without reading glasses on some of the text with the older Note 10.1. This new one has a much sharper, easier to read screen and I can put the reading glasses down again. It is a T Mobile unlocked unit which means it will work in theory with any GSM mobile phone service. It works on the AT&T network which is what Consumer Cellular uses for their service. I don't use this to make phone calls and don't know if that is even possible.","178","Samsung","8"

"6609","Samsung 32GB Galaxy Note 10.1"" Android 4G LTE Wi-Fi Dual Camera Unlocked Tablet","499.99","5","Great product! I waited to get a tablet until they got the stylus right, and this one does. It's as close to natural handwriting with a pencil or pen as any stylus ever. For me, the big advantage is taking handwritten notes, then uploading them to google drive so I don't have tons of loose pieces of paper that get lost. Converting handwriting to text doesn't work for me, my handwriting is too sloppy. With a minimal effort at neatness, it does a pretty good job at converting. Plus having all the other benefits of a tablet, and it's well laid out and easy to use. Battery life for me is excellent, I go days without recharging it but I don't do a lot of video or other high-drainage stuff. With my iphone as a hot spot, this is a great compromise between using just a smart phone (too hard to see, difficult to maneuver, keyboard hard to navigate) and a full laptop (too heavy and bulky) and reasonably priced, too.","178","Samsung","8"

"6656","Samsung 32GB Galaxy Note 10.1"" Android 4G LTE Wi-Fi Dual Camera Unlocked Tablet","499.99","4","The tablet I received has ""light bleeding"" in the upper right hand corner, and in several spots along the bottom edge. At first, I didn't even notice it but then two of my friends who own the same tablet informed me about it. I honestly didn't notice it until they told me! The light bleeding was initially only evident when I watched a bracketed movie or looked at photos that have dark borders. But then, over the next few days, whenever I pulled down the notification window, I could also see the problem at the bottom edge. The problem shows up in normal lighting, but more so when the screen is dark, like when watching movies.Other than that, the tablet works great. The screen is very nice and clear and functionally, the rest works most excellent! I am currently in-process of returning the tablet to Amazon for a refund and after that's cleared, I hope to purchase another 10.1 2014... hopefully, one without problems. LCD technology is way old, so light bleeding shouldn't exist nowadays unless it's a manufacturing defect. I've owned many Samsung LCD monitors, and several of their TV's and have never experienced light bleed on any of them. I'm hoping the tablet I got is an exception and not the rule for this model. Note that on the entire top and left edge, there is zero light bleeding out... sorry, I didn't take a photo of the entire tablet.3 stars for now, but I'll follow up later after I get a new tablet.UPDATE: Well I received the replacement tablet and it's still got light bleeding, but not as severe. Still a little disappointed, but I can live with this tablet as it's much better than the first one. Besides all the Samsung LCD devices I've owned over the years, I've also owned quite a few IBM/Lenovo laptops (4 of them), a few Dells, and HP's laptops also. None of them exhibited light bleeding, so I think this is a sign of poor QA on Samsung's part. Unfortunate! The only reasons I'm settling is because I really hate to deal with returns, not to mention the waiting involved for a replacement that might be even worse!I've changed my review to 4 Stars though as the tablet otherwise operates very nicely and the price is very good. Very Good! I'll be keeping it on Kitkat rather than allowing it to upgrade to Lollipop. Great tablet other than the screen bleeding! YMMV!","178","Samsung","8"

Buy it!","178","Samsung","8"
"6659","Samsung 32GB Galaxy Note 10.1"" Android 4G LTE Wi-Fi Dual Camera Unlocked Tablet","499.99","4","Bear in mind you're buying a product that's about two model-years old now, so don't expect miracles from it. It's a solid device for my purposes, which are basic workplace productivity types of tasks. I use the s-note functions a lot (I also have a note phone), and I have come to be quite reliant upon those apps. Very good interface, once you get used to it. I don't know why tablets are moving away from the stylus -- unless they're going to introduce bluetooth styluses that do the same things?Anyway, my only real gripes about this tablet are:1. Charging seems really slow. Like, really slow. To get from 50% to 100% can take what seems like hours.2. The s-pen is supposed to prevent your palm from interacting with the s-note program -- which it does 95% of the time. Every now and then, it randomly zooms because of something my palm is resting on.3. It gets oddly slow now and then -- possibly because I'm expecting too much? Anyway, I find that a reboot every day or two helps with the slowness.4. Data transfer by USB seems slower than I expected, but that may be unrealistic expectations on my part.Video looks great, on the rare occasions I use it, and the audio is surprisingly good. Lots of aftermarket covers are available for this device -- try a few to find the one you like. Some people want the cover with the keyboard built into it, but I'd rather carry a bluetooth keyboard separately, because sometimes I just don't care about having the keyboard available to me. Sometimes I only want the compact tablet device. The nice thing is that this one isn't exactly a laptop replacement, but for a weekend of travel in which you want to do more than you can do on your phone but you don't want to lug around a laptop, it works just fine. And it's easier to get one of these through airport security than it is to get a laptop through -- you don't have to take the tablet out of your bag. Or at least, I don't have to.Oh, and I have this same tablet in both this version (my wife's, actually) as well as my own tablet -- mine doesn't have the 4G LTE capability, but I haven't noticed any difference in performance between the two of them. She doesn't use the 4G on hers, and it doesn't seem to affect anything negatively as a result.If you like the idea of an integrated stylus, and you can get this at a good price (sub 400), this is a great option. I know it comes in a smaller size, but i wouldn't want it any smaller than it is. 10.1"" sounds like a bigger tablet, but it's really not that big. Much smaller and I'd have difficulty writing with it.","178","Samsung","8"

This has windows 7.5. It takes great pictures, although the camera has a small dark spot and everytime I take a picture, there is a small dark spot in every photo, I have learned to live with it since I dont take much pictures. It has a durable and strong screen. After a year of using it, it started giving me problems were it would freeze and turn off on its own constantly for several weeks. I had to reset the phone to its original settings, I had to lost all my apps, photos, videos etc. Phone works fine now, but I am being more careful with what i download since I think that is what caused it to malfunction. I was able to restored all my contacts since they are link to my email account. Not the photos or apps, those I had to restore again. I am using the pohone with simple mobile, I was told by simple mobile that since the phone it is an AT&T brand, it is the reason I cannot send photos vis msn, because there is something the at&t brand had block and cannot be unlocked. That if I connect the phone with at&t I would be able to send photos via msn. For the same reason I cannot use the phone's integrated gps. In other words 5 functions that comes with the phone you cannot use them unless you connected with at&t. But you can work your way around it if you just download the right app. I use whatsapp to be able to send pictures and a gps app I downloaded.","339","Samsung","8"

This phone was sold on Amazon by UnlockedCellPhoneKings and seemed used. It came with a Screen protector on. But overall had no signs of being worn.But the second time I bought the phone was even worst, the phone was sold directly by Amazon and it came with an Scratched Screen Protector. So my first question is:If the phone is new why does it have a Screen Protector on?And the most important question:Why does the Screen Protector has several scratches ?I don't have a replacement for the screen proctector yet, so I haven't removed it yet.... My biggest concern is that the Screen may be also scratched.I live in Ecuador so for me is very difficult to send it back.I'm very dissapointed and I feel like I have been scammed.","339","Samsung","8"

"6699","Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)","29.99","5","I like it ten times better than the Iphone. No forward facing camera isn't a deal breaker for me, because If I wanted to video chat, I'll just do that at home on my computer (when I have combed hair. lol..) I've had windows phones since the first windows mobile os (which wasn't good). Now they have Windows Phone OS; And microsoft has learned from old mistakes.Since the Mango update Windows phone is awesome. I love that It has office in the phone. This feels like a real work phone. The Iphone felt like, well an Ipod with a phone built in. I also love that I was able to add a 32gb SD card to up the memory. (It now has 36.6gbs free.) That means If I so please I can download movies or Xbox live games. :-) I was spazzing out on mirrors edge yesterday with the Focus. :-) & the hd video may be only 720p but it's good enough to make quality youtube videos. And it's flash is better than the Iphones flash.My choices were pay $$$$ for a new unlocked Iphone or unlocked Android or unlocked Blackberry, settle for a cheaper windows phone that only has 8gbs of rom, or get this older focus and upgrade it with the SD card. For less than the price of a used Iphone 3g, I got a factory unlocked phone that can do all the same things, but adds microsoft office, an hd camcorder, and the biggest factor is that this phone asks before distributing all your private user information.Originally I was onboard for an android, then the same day I was going to get one, a consumer watchdog group out of Santa Monica California issued a request to the US Attorney asking that Google and Apple be sued for billions of dollars due to their letting app developers access all personal data on people's phones. That, infact, is how many stalkers were invading celebrity cellphones. I'm not so worried about stalkers, but I don't like the thought of someone being able to hack my info just because I accidentally installed a shady app instead of angry birds. (and by the way even angry birds gets all your private info sent to them via Android & Iphone.)If you want to be in with the cool people and don't care about privacy issues or budget, go for an Iphone or an Android phone. If you want a phone that will do all the same things but won't give free reign to any app developer that wants to hack your phone, and you want to pay $$$ less for an unlocked phone; The Focus is a very good choice. Just remember to get the right SD card. Many don't work, and because people wouldn't read and research to get the right one, many people complained that they couldn't get it working right. Also many people didn't read the fact that the SD card intigrates into the OS, and therefore can not be removed or used to transfere files once it has been intigrated with the phone. Due to so many complaints by people that just don't bother to read the directions, they stopped putting the upgrade slot on the newer phones. That means the newer ones might have a better processor, but you have to go up to the most expensive models to even compete with the space you can have on this Focus i917.I may get another for my lady and retire her no privacy having Iphone. She already wants to trade. :-)Update May 1st, 2013:One month on and using the phone feels totally natural now. I have not lost any calls, had any crashes, or lost any data.Oh and I did replace her Iphone. She loves her Samsung Focus. Before she wouldn't risk her Iphone: she would switch sims and use a cheap flip phone if for example: we went to the beach or were going to ride on a boat or had an amusement park day. But now she uses her Iphone for the beach, flip phone is finally retired, and the Focus is protected & adorned. (^_^).","339","Samsung","8"

I am using this phone with a Mexico SIM card (Telcel) and is functioning perfect. I also tested it with a SIM card of USA and worked fine too.

"6735","Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)","29.99","1","Returned this item for a refund, not only because it was defective, but poorly designed as well (despite what the experts say) and because the Microsoft 30-day free music download appears to be a deliberate scam. As for the phone, the exterior Power On and Camera On buttons sometimes did not work. The touchscreen button for taking photos sometimes did not work. When positioning the camera lens, the screen constantly switches to a non-camera app, forcing you to start all over. The onscreen keyboard is infinitesimally small, so mistakes are a constant. As for the operating software, you cannot download the current Windows 8, but are stuck with Windows 7. When I downloaded and started playing music (courtesy of the so-called free trial), the phone shut down but kept playing the songs, so I had to remove and re-insert the battery to regain control of the device. When charging the device, the charge indicator screen never seemed to be the same one twice, and sometimes there was no indication at all of anything going on. (I eventually discovered that there's a little pull-down indicator at the top of the screen, but initially thought the battery or the charger did not work.)As for that free music trial, I clicked the ""Cancel this subscription"" on the Zune Marketplace screen, after connecting the device to my desktop computer. No sweat right? Wrong. This just takes you to Microsoft XBox login screen. After entering your password, MS says it still needs to ""verify"" who you are by sending a code to your email address. After retrieving and entering that, you select ""Account"", only to find that there is no cancel option anywhere to be found. The long, convoluted instructions for canceling provided by MS explain that you have to change your payment method first, although this guide doesn't correspond to the screens you actually see. At any rate, after changing away from the automatic renewal option as instructed, there is no message indicating the trial is cancelled and you're not allowed to remove your credit card info from the system. On another screen, you're instructed to call XBox to cancel a subscription. Going down this new rabbit hole, you're instructed to fill out a page with your request and provide your phone number so MS can call you in 2 minutes. But after you submit the request, you get an error message saying it didn't work and you should try again later. Boy, last time I check, this sort of con game involving interstate commerce was outlawed by the FTC. The only recourse seems to be waiting for the charge to show up on the credit card and disputing it through your bank.","339","Samsung","8"

I constantly have to turn it on or off, or remove and reinsert the battery in order for it to work properly. Also, the battery life is very inconsistent. Sometimes, a charge can last a couple of days. Other times, a charge won't even last one full day with the same average usage.

I need a decent voice volume and clarity, a small and light weight, a calendar. I do NOT texting or play games, I only need email and internet for emergency. Camera and video will be used on rare occasions. This phone offers everything INFUSE offers and only costs 2/3's of the price. The camera and video quality is so so, who cares, I do not rely on them.

"6756","Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)","29.99","5","I purchased this phone a few days ago to replace my LG Thrive. I researched the phone to double check it is compatible with AT&T's GoPhone Prepaid program and sure enough it is (AT&T sell this phone in their GoPhone section only at $499). The phone was delivered the day after in good condition and it was sold by BLUTEKUSA. The phone looks new and has no noticeable fingerprints or marks that would indicate it's been used, although the box it came in was obviously opened before. It came with the phone, charger, and a pair of headphones.The Samsung Focus is pretty easy to set up. It asks for date and time as well as a Windows Live ID which can be synced with later if so desired. The screen is beautiful, Super AMOLED making the display rich in brightness and color. There are physical buttons for the Power button, Camera, and Volume Control. It's plastic, so the phone is pretty light, although to the point where one might consider it cheap. The back is a thing plastic case that snaps onto the phone. Taking off the back is a bit on the scary side as I felt I might have snapped it the few times I tried. Overall the phone is a nice build just not one that screams high quality.The Camera takes really good pictures and I was impressed with the 720p video recording as well. Again, not high-end, but it's above average nonetheless.I updated the Samsung Focus to Windows Mango and the software is fantastic. The interface is easy on the eyes and is smooth. I have not seen any hiccups on this phone even though it only comes with 512mb ram, although that seems to be a restriction from Microsoft. To me, it has just as much polish as iOS (the operating system that the iPhone/iPad run) although it lacks a lot of the customization of Android (not really missing it). It integrates Facebook and other social network clients into one area and so far I love it. The keyboard is easy to use as well and have not had any trouble misspelling words.*Edit* Fixed problem with the SIM Card. This phone is excellent. Windows Phones are under appreciated.","339","Samsung","8"

I did alot of research and decided on the windows phone based on the occasional clunkiness of android. Though I really like the iphone, it's just too muchh $$ and a contract. We recieved the phone in new condition and at first having played around with it a little I really didnt like it that much. I updated to Mango which is cool, but it really took a week of playing with it to decide it really is a great phone. My wife uses her camera alot, and this one has a very good camera. I went out the other night and took some pics outside in the pitch black, I couldnt see what I was aiming at until the flash went off, but the pics were really good. Today we went to the beach as there was a big storm and we took pics side by side and the focus produced much better pics than my nexus one. There are a few things that I like better about android for sure. Live wallpapers for one, and the stupid colored tiles on windows. I mean really, gee I get to pick my color for by big tiles? thats it? I was hoping these ""live"" tiles would be like customizable to a much greater extent then they are. The other thing I dont like is the app store. It's niether layed out as well, nor does it have that many apps compared to the compitition. So, why five stars? well really it's about the phone. The screen is great, it's very responsive, excellent camera, great call or signal strength and the battery for us has not been an issue. I do like this windows OS. I'm really hoping they will s**t or get off the pot (microsoft) and dedicate themselves to developing this OS. It has that much potential. In general I hate most microsoft products, so I am really pleased even for it's shortcomings. All in all, considering the price it's really a five star phone.","339","Samsung","8"

You don't have skype and sugarsync apps but they said they are coming soon.The bad part of Windows Phone 7.5 is that you need to integrate the memory card to the file system. Its not hot swap and also you cant transfer files with the memory card because it gets formatted during the integration process. TheThe only way to transfer files to the phone is by mail or skydrive. With the Focus you don't get the Hotspot feature.For the user that is in Venezuela you can use the marketplace, i am in El Salvador.

Sound quality was decent, and when wI-fi was available, for example at an airport, or hotel, my E-mail account was readily accessible. There were some other features that were equally impressive.Unfortunately, yesterday I plugged in the USB cable to charge the 'phone, and heard a ""pop"", which turned out to be an indicator of it's quick and merciful death. So it only lasted about 14 months. It seems some other reviewers have experienced varying degrees of shortened life span and a similar quick death with their Samsung Focus I917. Can't say if it's the brand or just the luck of the draw that I got one of a small percentage of electronic devices that will fail prematurely.In my case I met the phone's demise with mixed emotions, since I never got real comfortable with the Windows 7 O.S.

"6766","Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)","29.99","2","If so, here you go. No, that is not an exaggeration.You see, a few months into ownership, this phone would prompt you to turn it offRandomly, without any contact to the power button. Sometimes while you aren't doing anything.Sometimes while the screen is locked.Reject it/Swiping away cause it to stall. Turning it off results in the same lack of turning on.Sure, you'll be able to turn it on. But it crashes before actually turning on.If you take the battery out, and put it back in, it will immediately start trying to turn on.It should not do this. When you put the battery in normally, it stays off until you power it on.Thus, it stalls again. My guess is your attempts to start it restart after doing this as well, because it seems to take a certain number of trys to get it to run.When its on the charger, the 3 bottom buttons lose functionality. You need those to do just about everything.You can hold the back arrow to access previous things you've been doing, but not while connected. you'll only get a single press.and then you have to wait 5 seconds to get another.Imagine trying to watch Netflix and someone texts you. You can only get that message shortcut if you do it RIGHT THEN.if you don't, you have to the app. but then with the time it takes you to get back to Netflix, you have another text.STILL RUNNING 7.5. STILL WAITING ON 7.8. THIS IS MARCH OF 2014, CLOSE TO APRIL.Great otherwise when it works. Better sound quality than a lot of other 7.5 devices.","339","Samsung","8"

"6772","Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)","29.99","5","I don't use a smartphone much due to limited reception in my office area. But I like the features on a smartphone. So I didn't want to pay a lot or get stuck in a contract. I got this phone for about sixty on sale (wow, Amazon, that was pretty sweet!) and I'm delighted with it. It does more than my old Nokia X2 and I can always upgrade to full smartphone service if I need to. Right now, I have this on pay-as-you-go T-Mobile with my current SIM chip and don't do email or Web. I could change to PlatinumTel and even pay less on texting, and pay 10ct per 10MB of data--enough for email. I don't stream video or do internet on the phone--just need access to email on occasion.The setup was not bad, but took some time. I had the SIM chip (the T-Mobile) in the phone and was able to call and text. However, there was a bit of trouble with the reset--you hold the volume, the camera-on and the power buttons down simultaneously, and as soon as it vibrates, you release the power button but hold the rest until the REFORMAT screen appears. If you get the Download Mode Screen, you have to pop out the battery, power down (just powering down via the button doesn't work as it freezes at this point.) Then try again. I had to try quite a few times to get that screen up. The reformat is necessary for your SIM card to recognize the new phone.I was able to load the stored phone numbers from the previous phone, then access voicemail. The sound was a lot better than my previous phone and the operation on a touch screen is easy.I was not able to find a number of apps I wanted, as Windows Phone is not as popular as Android and that is not as popular as Apple. You'd think, with Windows OS being huge in computers, that there'd be more connectivity to phones, but it is definitely the 3rd best phone OS. Has a way to go.I was able to put it on my home WiFi and link the Bluetooth to my car handsfree system with no trouble at all.For the price, this is a great, functional phone. It isn't the be-all-end-all of phones, but for someone like me who is not a heavy cell phone user, it is delightful. I am very happy with it and I may either use my old Nokia as a backup emergency phone or donate it to those organizations who give phones to soldiers for calling home.","339","Samsung","8"

The software was upgraded and the phone was even reset to manufacture's setting, yet still to no avail. Called Samsung, a polite gentleman with Hindi accent couldn't help me at all, and then the tech at Microsoft suggested to reset the phone back the manufacture's setting though he hinted the possibility the phone would be locked with AT&T again - I am with T-Mobile. Even tried a new battery and everything else I could think of; no, nada, I'am back to square one to find another phone now.

The only thing that could be better would be the availibility of phone settings. I think this is a limitation of the Windows Phone 7 O.S. On the one hand, since there are few settings, it is easy to set up. On the other hand, since there are few settings, you can not pick and choose when to use your data plan versus your WIFI during a specific action. It is on or off for WIFI, DATA, BLUETOOTH, AIRPLANE MODE. (My old Nokia had the ability to ask which network to use for every connection, which I liked.)While it defaults to WIFI when WIFI is present, it turns off WIFI in sleep mode to conserve battery life. I was kind of shocked to find that I used up 10 MB one night while I was asleep. A quick search finds this as a common complaint.I am on AT&T's Pay-As-You-Go plan, 10 cents per minute and I prepay for data, $5 for 10MB, $10 for 100MB, and $25 for 500MB. What I do is to pay $5.00 per month for the data plan, which rolls over my available data. This works out to about $100 every 6 months or so.There were no problems whatsover getting this phone up and running. It connects nicely with Microsoft's Skydrive. You can enter all of your contacts and calendar entries in Hotmail, and it syncs nicely with your phone, to give you a constant backup.Nothing bad to say, it looks great, there are plenty of apps available, and overall, it's a winner.Edit: There is one thing I'm not used to. There are no reminders for missed calls or text messages. So, I do have to keep looking whenever I am away from my phone.","339","Samsung","8"

I have never had or even played with a phone this stellar. Previously I have had a blackberry, a galaxy and a gravity. There are many well created things that go along with this phone but at the same time, there are a few downsides. Here's a pros cons list to help out...Pros* Very nice screen, surpasses any other touch-screen I've used* Very easy to learn the functions included* A lot of customization options included in interface* Uses standard Micro-USB charger* Has X-Box live capabilities* A generous sized screen* Can use internet over WI-FI* Zune music and videoCons* Battery can sometimes only last for 24 hours* If on T-Mobile or other carrier besides AT&T cannot send or receive pictures* Low quality cameraAnother heads up would be that if you want to sign into your current X-Box live account, make sure to use the e-mail linked to that account or else it will set u up with an automatic account and you cant change it unless you proceed with a master reset :( i made that mistake when i first got the phone. Anyways overall, I would say that this phone is a 9/10 for battery use and X-Box live. I would HIGHLY recommend this phone if you are between two different ones.","339","Samsung","8"

Later on moving onto Android based phones and enjoying those as well. When there was a lot of positive feedback on windows 7.5 mobile and my other phone being drowned in beef stock. I decided to take the plunge with this little gem.Upon receiving the phone the packaging was no frills, and made me nervous. Before running the phone I charged the battery and installed an additional 8gb micro sd card I got for 19.99 (PNY MicroSD) because in the documentation WP7 takes over the SD card for good!The operating system takes up about 1.2 GB so keep that in mind.I love the fact that I can delete the ATT default applications since I am on TMobile pre-paid (50$ unlimited). Yes it is only limited to 2G (edge) speed.Updating the phones software was the only difficulty I had. While updating I got a backup error causing it to not update. I believe it was the front USB port I was using on my computer but at the same time I used a different Micro USB cable from my mytouch and plugged it in a usb port in the back of my computer. Once I did that I was able to apply the 2 updates through the Zune software (required)Anyway, setting up the phone was easy enough. Adding my google account synced up my contacts/calendar/email (important since I came from using android)Another important mention for tmobile users is that you have to go to the marketplace and install the Samsung Network Profile app and select tmobile usa. After that you can send and receive MMSThe picture on this screen is beautiful, the camera has a lot of customization features, the UI is simple and clean I couldn't be happier with this phone at this price point.","339","Samsung","8"

Much better than the iPhone, HTC and Motorola displays. It truly is amazing and works good in all conditions including outdoors. The Samsung Captivate (android phone) also has the same screen. If fact, Samsung is now switching all their future phones to use AMOLED.SOUND:The Speaker and call quality is very good. I have used a lot of phones and I can tell you this is the best yet. The speaker phone sounds just as good as a full size home phone. Compared to my daughters new iPod, the Focus speaker is way better, and she even admitted it.SPEED:Windows Phone 7 powered by the snapdragon 1GH processor is very fast. No lag, no screen delay, no issue flicking and scrolling. Fast internet browser as well.FEATURES:I am very impressed how polished Windows Phone 7 is, and I think its going to get better. Microsoft is putting a great deal of money into it and consumers get the reward. The Windows Phone 7 live tiles are so much better than old school icons on most other phones.SUMMARY:This phone is truly ahead of its time. There are people that will say the iPhone or Android is better, but that is only bias because they probably have never used this phone and compared the features I mentioned above.

"6805","Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)","29.99","4","I'd really been looking forward to an escape from the Android OS and all the problems I had with it in the year since I began using my Samsung SG-I9000. Apple's iPhone was tempting because of its functionality, but it was so overly-hyped and trendy I had many second thoughts about it. I've used an iPhone here and there before and it was simple, but just didn't feel like something I wanted in the long-term. Windows Phone was already on the scene but there were no stores selling them at the time where I live, so after reading review after review, I decided to take a leap of faith and grab the Samsung I917, aka the Focus.The GOOD: First, the operating system is head, shoulders, torso, hips, thighs, knees, calves and ankles above anything else on the market. It's just so simple and intuitive, not to mention beautiful. And unlike Android, it's the exact same from device to device, so the user experience is consistent. Zune integration is beautiful. I can sync all my Zune music on my computer to my phone either by plugging in or over a wi-fi connection. I can also download from the marketplace over the air and then sync back to my computer next time I connect. The People tab is great because it lets me see what all my contacts are doing over social networks all in one place. The phone is also physically beautiful. I especially like the pinstriped back of the case. The device is thin and light and quick (after all, it's basically a first-gen Galaxy S).The BAD: The phone is pretty plasticy, and while it's actually pretty tough, I would really like to see Samsung put out a ""pro"" version made of duraluminum, like their Series 9 laptops are made of. I'm pretty rough on my phones, watches, etc, so I always appreciate rugged versions of products when applicable. The build quality is good but it just doesn't feel overly tough to me, which is the basis of my 4-star rating.The UGLY: Windows Phone marketshare. Seriously, this OS is so amazing, so beautiful, and so simple to use, this should have been 15% - 20% by now in my opinion. Give this phone a chance folks, you'll be glad you did. It's different, it's beautiful, and it's going to be around for a long time.","339","Samsung","8"

I did some online checking but was unable to determine if cell-to-ear volume was a specific model weakness. Three points from my ordering experience: 1) check the vendor's return policy before purchasing; 2) when you receive the order check the phone properties first--it's easy to become enchanted with smartphones to the point of overlooking the basic on ear use; 3) buyers should reflect on the liklihood that any unlocked cell listed is actually new.To date I've found my second phone to be sleek, with the Windows 7 system impressive. Apps are increasingly available and diverse, not the walled garden of Iphone.Of contacting Samsung: dealing with customer support (Samsung or any other) be aware you likely will interact with a rep--working from a script--who has no cellular expertise. Check the manual carefully before entering the customer service ordeal.You'll be directed through two corrections, soft reset, and if the problem remains, hard reset. (You can find both on any model via web search). If these two corrections fail you're at the point of sending the phone in for repair or returning to seller.If you do need to contact Samsung, I found Facebook easier than web site contact. Twitter is also an option.Sept. 2016 update: I'm getting ready to upgrade from the i917. The phone has held up with no problems.

This phone is fast, the screen looks amazing and the sound is pretty impressive for a cel phone.The price is affordable and surprising.When you start with Windows Phone 7 is a breeze of fresh air vs other mobile OS, once upgraded to Mango then you gain a lot of features like multitasking, copy/paste and live notifications.The BIG problem here is the Marketplace: The developers are not publishing here at the same rate or quality than iOS or Android...sure, it's a secure Market (due to Microsoft filters) but lacks content.The BIGGEST problem comes when you are not from US (like me) and, in order to be able to purchase apps, need to migrate to a non-US Market...the apps here (worldwide Market) are terrible or non-existent at most, the games are far from decent and Bing maps barely identifies mayor streets on capital cities.These issues needs to addressed by Microsoft ASAP, there is no way they could try to compete with Apple or Google seriously with so much restrictions on app publishing on other Markets.Pros:CheapFastGreat ScreenMango Update makes the OS shineLightweightCons:MarketplaceBattery Life","339","Samsung","8"
"6812","Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)","29.99","5","I got this phone from ""Unlocked Cell Phone Kings"" and it appears to be just as new as it was advertised to be. It was a good value and connected to AT&T very easily. I am using a $25/mo. off contract plan that allows unlimited texting and 250 minutes a month. The wifi connections have been very solid, so I am happy with that I decided to save 30 dollars a month while still getting the majority of the functionality I was looking for.Design: 4/5Overall I like the design. I would have liked it to be made out of more durable materials, but it certainly looks good. The front is a solid flat surface and the back is grayish with pin-striping that really is well done. The back is curved slightly, which helps to prevent it from being too slippery as it could be, with it being made out of smooth glossy plastic. The screen is very bright, but is made of plastic, so it could easily get scratched.Performance: 4/5It is fast enough. Downloads don't take long, and I have never seen a stutter. It upgraded to Mango without any issues using the Zune software I already had on my laptop. It plays Netflix perfectly with no noticeable pixelation or lag. It could load a couple of things faster, but overall load speeds are quite decent. The OS masks any slowdowns it might have by using fanciful transition effects. Voice quality has been good, but there have been reports of echoing from people on the other end of the calls.Value: 5/5At $240 I will save $200 or more during my first year on AT&T, and $400 or more during my second year. I call that value.","339","Samsung","8"

Need to have spare battery if you are a heavy user.Window Apps are far fewer than android market could offer.The phone works better with AT&T even though unlocked.Every time you put a Tmobile SIM card, you need to factory reset the phone. Or it will not recognize. But will work very well after reset.On Tmobile service, if use data plan, only 2g Edge is available, even though the phone has 4g function.Samsung online chatting service is very good, if you need customer service.Additional storage seems a pain in the neck. But normally 8 gb is enough.Update: I have had the phone 9 months now: the phone sometimes will quit starting. the first time when I could not start the phone, I connected the phone to computer and reinstall ZUNE and update -- do not know what really worked -- i tried these steps -- reinstall, remove battery and put in again, remove sim card, and put in again. when connected to computer -- it somehow came back to life.The second time, i contacted samsung -- not really a lot of direct help -- it seems that what the rep meant was an non oem battery was used which caused the problem. -- i put the original battery in, did not come back, connected to computer update ZUNE again, not work, finally, remove sim card, and put in back in === it came back to life.THIS PHONE IS PAIN IN THE NECK, IF YOU REALLY LIKE SAMSUNG BUY A DIFFERENT MODEL.Upgrade to 7.5, you will find addition features and Chinese language.","339","Samsung","8"

"6837","Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)","29.99","4","If you are wanting to give a Windows smart phone a try this phone I highly recommend it. It's a nice solid phone. I've had mine for 4 months and I'm still pretty happy with it. The back is plastic with good looking pinstripes and some might complain that adding a certain cheapness to it but I disagree. It still looks great and very easy to remove if necessary and if made from metal would only increase overall weight and probably be a little trickier to remove having to line up slots just right. As it is it snaps off and on with ease. The overall feel is good and solid with nice curved edges making it a good looking phone as well. The 5 mega-pixel camera takes good pics too. The Super-Amoled touchscreen is great and easy to see in almost all light conditions even under a bright sun.The Windows os; as far as I can tell I like it. I can't comment on the Android or ios as I haven't used them. I can only say that what I've read is that Android is a mess. It is by far the most popular and looks like it will be for sometime. It appears that Google has very low if any standards in place for phone manufactures. Many of them with the hardware needed to fully run Android. Windows has placed standards on how Windows phones should be made so they run smoothly with little or no issues and at the same time keeping requirements at a level to keep accessible to most consumers. Most comments I've read about I phones is that while at one time cutting edge are not anymore as their platform is getting stale, have run out of ideas, running on brand only. Windows was designed with the user in mind to have an interface easy and intuitive to use and customizable enough for almost everyone and have become the one with the ideas now.There are some caveats I'd like to point out. The button placement could be better. The lock-screen button is directly opposite of the volume and too easy to press when trying to adjust volume. The light sensor works and locks the screen when making a phone call but not when putting it in a pocket or purse. It won't automatically lock itself leading to pocket calls, pictures of your pocket and voice commands. The only way to prevent this is to remember to press the lock-screen button. One of my fears is this button wearing out fast from having to use it so much. Most of these phones will be AT&T phones so be prepared. They have Windows 7.5 and no plan or talk to release any update. There are several work-arounds to this. One being to plug phone in to computer, start the Zune software, click on phone update under the settings then unplug the internet connection from the computer after 2 or 3 seconds. It's real tricky to say the least and one that I couldn't ever get to work. There is a cab file to download on your computer and do it that way. The easiest is an application called seveneighter that will do the whole thing for you. I used that method a month ago without any problems.I recommend going to the windowsphone subreddit for any help you might need. Samsung has a user manual available on their website with many tips and information not available anywhere else. Windowsphonehacker.com has the seveneighter file that I mentioned to update your phone with great help articles as well.","339","Samsung","8"

"6839","Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)","29.99","4","I have owned a Samsung Focus for two and a half years now. It was my primary phone until the Lumia 920 came out in November. Since then, I keep my Focus around when I travel out of the country and in situations where I would not want my primary phone to get lost or damaged.My first Focus lasted over 18 months, surviving frequent drops, tosses, pockets with keys, heavy rain and other disasters. This is much better than any cell phone I had used up until that point. I finally managed to crack the screen dropping down some cement steps. I replaced it with an HTC Surround, which barely lasted 4 months under the same conditions. After the HTC phone died, I went and got a new unlocked Focus on Amazon.Though tough, the phone is a finger print magnet. It also feels really cheap and lightweight. For all their cool kit inside, Samsung never produced a phone that looks and feels as expensive as it is.The hardware on the phone was great in 2010, and still feels pretty good today. The AMOLED screen is bright and very vibrant but a little pixelated. The Sound is pretty good. The phone uses NAND memory, which is faster than many SD card based phones. There is an expandable SD card slot (the only Windows Phone 7 device to have one), and the removable battery is a huge plus when traveling.Tinkerers will like the Focus too. That SD card comes in handy, and the unlocked boot loader allows you to flash custom Windows Phone ROMs. You won't be getting Windows Phone 8, but you can flash to 7.8, however. Right now, there are only a few games and apps that require WP8 (Temple Run, Modern Combat 4 are two examples).At $100, this phone is less than half the cost of a budget Lumia 520. The phone is certainly cannot keep up with high end phones today, but it does not feel slow or obsolete like Android phones from 2010.","339","Samsung","8"

"6850","Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)","29.99","5","I have now had the phone for a day. The build is great, screen is beautiful and the O/S is really nice, clean, well thought out and intuitive. I would say this is about as good as an iPhone competitor as one might find-in some ways, even better. I do have one serious problem with the phone though...many web sites do not render properly! Would anyone know why? Is it a setting or the way the phone was built? If I can not figure it out, I will have to return the phone. I can deal with the lack of apps but at this point, I can not deal without a better functioning browser. Thanks for your help.I have now used the phone for about 2 weeks on a regular basis...no problems with web rendering...I don't know what was wrong. I bought this phone as an unlocked phone to use on GSM when traveling and now I have a problem; when I am home, I use a iPhone on Verizon..( I did have iPhones on AT&T previously), but now that I am home it is difficult to decide which I prefer, the iPhone or the focus. In many ways the windows phone is actually easier to use then the iPhone. The only downside for now seems to be the lack of apps on the Windows phone but I am sure, that will change. Of course the other consideration when home is the fact that Verizon's service is much better then either tmobile or AT&T. Either way, the windows o/s is top notch and given a bit more time, could easily present a challenge/alternative to a iPhone. By the way, I have also used a Droid Pro previously and I must admit, I prefer the windows o/s versus android!","339","Samsung","8"
"6851","Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)","29.99","5","I have been using this phone for about two months by now. Before I bought the Samsung Focus I owned the HTC Surround, Apple's iPhone 3GS, and HTC Touch Pro. I will review not just the phone, because I think the OS is also very important when talking about a WP7 Phone.Dimensions and Characteristicsthe screen size is bigger than iPhone's 3G or 4G. Talking about image quality, I prefer the Focus, the image is brighter and color look awesome. This phone is really slim and light, the opposite of HTC Surround, which is much thicker and heavier because of the sliding speaker. The built in camera is good and you have a good flash light also which is nice to have when taking pictures in dark ambience, but of course, the image quality is much lower than using a digital camera.User InterfaceMicrosoft has done a great job redesigning the screens in WP7 (now WP7.5) with ""Metro"". You will see that the icons (which are called tiles) in the main screen are ""alive"" and are not static icons like the iPhone or Android or Blackberry. The tile gives you information about your contacts or a group of contacts (updates from Windows Live, Facebook, My Space, Messenger, Twitter and LinkedIn). Now many applications are using live tiles to give you specific information so don't have to launch the app to see some important information. Also live tiles make the main screen more attractive... I like them.Zune vs. iTunesAfter using iTunes for several years, I just realized that if you don't have an Apple's computer, then you will have some troubles using iTunes (at least that's my experience). I have to say that I like Zune much more than I like iTunes. Zune is all about multimedia, the user interface is really nice, full of watermarks which change depending of what you are viewing and that makes you enjoy using the software, the opposite feeling when I use iTunes which I consider boring and I use it because I have to in order to synchronize my iPod.TouchscreenI think Focus' touchscreen responds better than iPhone's 3GS or 4G. The screen responds incredible fast (compared to iPhone) and touch is very accurate (much better than I got in Touch Pro... I can't even compare them!)Marketplace vs. AppstoreIn Ecuador the items you can purchase from Appstore is very limited due copyright terms (but Apple opened many items last week for Ecuador). In US you will find a lot of more applications in Appstore than Marketplace, even though Microsoft is doing a great job with developers, but there is a long way to go. I would really like to have applications in Marketplace like Google Maps (even though you have gMaps) and Skype (which has been announced to be delivered be the end of 2011). If you think the applications are something really important when you have to pick your phone, then I recommend that you look at Zune or Marketplace if those applications you really like are available for WP7. If the application is not in available, then you can check at developer's forums if there are any plans to develop the software, but now you can find almost every great application in WP.KeyboardIf you are used to type using a built-in keyboard (like Blackberry 9300 or similar), then you will have some troubles while you get used to type on the screen. iPhone's and HTC's keyboard work pretty much the same, both respond fast and the size of the letters are good enough to type without making many mistakes. You can turn on the grammar checker that helps you to correct misspelled words (several languages now with Mango Update). Even though 99% of the time I write in Spanish, I have to say that the spell checker works great.Office HubI expected more from WP7 Office hub. The office applications are extremely basic and I still don't know how to synchronize documents from the phone to the PC (without using Skydrive), or transfer files from the PC to the Phone.ConclusionIn conclusion, I am not an expert about phones; but I have used several models and OS and I really like WP7 (which is completely different of Windows Mobile. WM was the worst OS I have used!).With Mango Update (also known as Windows Phone 7.5) you can create groups of your contacts and pin the group to the home screen. Since you can link information from Messenger, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter of your contacts, live tiles will tell you if anyone of your contacts in the group has shared something in any of those networks and you can make any comment or share anything you want without using any app, because everything is integrated in the OS, but not everything is perfect, now I have to charge the phone twice a day, actually now I have a charger at home, at office and the car (I hope there is a way to fix this because the battery lasts some time 5 or 6 hours, if you play a game then it will last 1 hour).In the Message Hub now you can send messages not only using the regular SMS, you can send messages to your contacts in Messenger and Facebook Chat. The phone will let you know if the contact you are writing to is connected to one of those two networks (or both), otherwise it will suggest sending a regular SMS.I am really happy with this phone and I don't find any reason to go back to iPhone or change to Android. I also think this phone is better than HTC Surround due to a better screen, is lighter and has a better camera.","339","Samsung","8"

I popped in my T-Mobile SIM card and the phone was good to go.I think my phone came with a defective battery: it takes over four hours to charge. I'm looking to get that replaced.The AMOLED screen is amazing. The system is fast, responsive, and looks great. It's programmed in C#, if you're into that sort of thing :-). But I'll skip all the awesome stuff that you've already read about. Let me mention a few of the current downsides.* You must use Microsoft's Zune software to manage music.I prefer mp3 players which act like USB drives. I.e. you plug them in and your filesystem browser displays the contents as regular folders and files. This Windows Phone doesn't work this way.There is apparently some registry hack to work around this, but it would be nice if Microsoft supported this out of the box.* No sleep timer - There are a couple of free ones on the marketplace, but they aren't ideal.* No FLAC support* No OGG support* T-Mobile users: Sending pictures in texts doesn't seem to work.* T-Mobile users: Seems like the data speed is limited to 2G. I don't have a high-end data plan so I'm not so concerned about this. The Wi-Fi speeds are great of course.UPDATE 2011-12-14* I got picture texts to work by installing the Samsung Network Profile app and selecting 'T-Mobile' in it's configuration.","339","Samsung","8"

We called Samsung directly and they had us hard boot the phone. After several attempts, the hard boot completed, but the problem was still the same. I know the description says no warranty, but if this is a ""new phone"" as advertised, I would think we should be able to get our money back (or replacement). Planning to call to selling company to see if that would be an option--if this truly was a ""new phone"", it should not have died after only six weeks of use. Very sad.","339","Samsung","8"

I only suggest that when you have WiFi connection available and if your data plan is not very big, you can disable data plan on configuration and use WiFi while you can.

All in all it's a very nice interface. I prefer over Apple and Droid.The phone itself is great. Looks nice, fast, expandable memory, the camera takes a decent picture and battery life is quite good.The apps selection is okay but their interface is quite different from their Droid and Apple counter parts. Yelp for example is bizarre to use when compared to the latest version on Apple or Droid. It uses a Windows phone style interface which has a different screen flow. I don't think 3rd party apps have a good grasp on how to develop for this platform. I will say the app selection is improving though. If you love apps I'd probably skip this phone. If you need a phone for email and Facebook this phone will work very well for you.Bing maps works well in the US but not as well in Canada as Google maps. Still it is very good when compared to Apple's new map app.Tip: Make sure when you get the phone update the OS right away. It runs so much better and is well worth the effort.","339","Samsung","8"

I got my phone, and learned it was not unlocked; however, if a person were to do a simple google search, there are many instructions on how to do this very easily! To give a product 1 star just because it didn't come unlocked seems very unreasonable.The phone itself is great. I have no contract currently, but using existing wifi I am able to download apps, music, games, and many more things.I only removed one star because it did not come unlocked but I do not feel it should be a score of 1 star.I was able to unlock the phone myself, but I will not give out the instructions, like I said, google is your friend.The phone is responsive and sleek. The plastic is a little cheap, but not by much. The screen can be wiped of finger prints easily. I am going to be getting a screen protector and a case for this phone later on. A lot of the windows games that play on this phone seem to do okay. Some of the real knew games lag a bit but I feel it is still good quality.Because this phone is refurbished, I thought I would get it with some scratches or blemishes. This is not so. It came without any problems! I was very surprised.Amazon Warehouse rules!If a person has the money, get this phone but if you have even MORE money, get an android or apple product because their stores have millions of apps and games while windows is still building theirs.","339","Samsung","8"

"6886","Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)","29.99","5","I ordered the Samsung Focus I917 unlocked phone because the price was good and I wanted to test out Windows 7 OS. My carrier is Consumer Cellular and a 2nd sim card from them was free plus adding the phone to my account is just 10 dollars a month. I received the card and phone on the same day, inserted the card and voila, I was making calls. Before doing that I inserted a 32 gig microSD card so now I have a ton of memory to work with. Setting up wireless with my home network was a snap and using the USB connection to download the updates and apps I want was easy (GPS, Google stuff, etc.). I had to download those things because the phone is pre-loaded with AT&T proprietary apps and no AT&T account, no working apps. The nicest surprise I got was that Windows office is preloaded. I had to set up Skydrive on my both my home PC and the phone but now I can download and edit documents (word, excel, powerpoint) whenever I like. What wasn't nice was that cellular data connection wasn't working. At first I was blaming it on the phone not being unlocked but that wasn't the case, a call to Consumer Cellular support and 5 minutes later I was using my cellular data connection to the web. So, bottom line: its not going to be perfectly set up out of the box and may require working with your carrier service but once its set up, its great. If you have to consult with your cellular carrier you'll need your IMEI number. It'll speed things up if you already have it and you can get it by dialing *#06# on your phone and writing down the number for their use. Oh, you need to install ZUNE onto your PC, I'm not particularly impressed with it but its no big deal, I only use it to sync music anyway.","339","Samsung","8"

That means that those of you hoping to use it on T-mobile will have 3G in some places, (everywhere T-mobile has ""refarmed"" their towers to work on 1900Mhz.)","339","Samsung","8"

The phone Is incredibly responsive. The mango update has added many features, the camera takes great pictures in low light. My only critisim is that No usb charging cord was included so I had to wait for a new one to come in mail before I could update to Mango. I replaced my Tmobile mytouch 4g for this phone and it was one of the best Choices I made. My only annoyance is that I'm using a tmobile sim card and since it is AT&T it doesn't support tmobile 3G bands. This means the Internet can be rather slow at times. Overall, I would suggest that EVERYONE buys this phone because it has so many features for such a low price.","339","Samsung","8"

I went down the block to Radio Shack and they had an Ultra SanDisk 32g micro memory card that said it was Windows compatible for $28. I used the phone to call back home many times without any problems. My friends took many photos and videos at the concert and they all came out crystal clear. Even the ones that the kids took. I had every intention on giving this phone to my friends when I was leaving to go back home. It was the best purchase I ever made. I purchased it for less than $100 and it is worth so much more.

It came when the delivery said it would and I've been fiddling and adding contacts so far. I like how fast it is and it definitely doesn't seem like a 'older' smartphone. It's very sensitive, which I had to get used too. It also doesn't seem like it can break easy and isn't really flimsy. I like the design of it, but I'm a bit disappointed that I can't use the AT&T GPS without signing a 10 dollar a month free. That's not really that big of a deal as there's a built in app called ""Maps' That does basically the same. It finds your locations very quickly and is basically like a map quest.

Touchscreen can not be any better.Lots of app are available , so definitely i would recommend anyone who wants to buy a smartphone at a reasonable price. 8 gb internal memory is a plus, as no other unlocked phone at this price offers such a big amount of internal storage. However , you may face some problems using external sd card.The phone came with windows phone 7.0 operating system.

"6943","Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)","29.99","4","Time for the review. In short, I am very happy with my purchase. I was under the false impression that smart phones were very expensive and the data packages were still $20-25 extra a month. You CAN turn data on this phone OFF (Settings, Cellular, Data Connection) and just use the WI-FI but I chose to have a package that allows me some browsing at only $10 extra a month.This is with T-mobile.This phone does not come with a computer cord, and there is already an update available for it, so I strongly recommend purchasing a USB cable for it so you can update immediately. WITHOUT THE UPDATE, YOU CAN'T ACCESS APPS. The updates are free.I also could not get picture messages without downloading the app called Network Profile which is also a free app.Now that the apps and picture messages are working, I can safely say it is a very nice phone.After the update you can also voice text, which is the only thing I wished this phone had prior to me downloading the update. Now it does.This is a Windows operating system which means only Windows apps are available. You can't get Instagram, Snapchat, or a lot of other popular ones. When an app is created it's almost always made for Apple or Android products first, and Blackberry and Windows devices later, if at all. So that kind of sucks.The price on this phone tends to fluctuate. I paid $135 and a week later my sister paid $98.","339","Samsung","8"
"6944","Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)","29.99","3","Straight from the vendor the phone is, in fact, unlocked (we use it on T-Mobile, but it should work with any GSM network with a SIM card, but NOT Verizon or Sprint or CDMA networks). This is our second Samsung Focus (the first was directly through Amazonwireless) and we love this phone! AT&T has dropped the ball big-time on updates, however, and you can only upgrade it to WP 7.5 Mango. There are several security/bug fix updates in between WP 7.5 and 7.8 that AT&T will not allow Microsoft to push to your phone, but overall this is a great entry-level smart phone and you simply cannot beat the price now that it has been out a couple of years. Since the phone is branded to AT&T (even though it is unlocked and can be used on any GSM network) you will simply not be able to get any updates on this phone until AT&T decides to bless you with them (which in all likelihood based on their history, is NEVER).Also, the box that the phone came in was sealed, but did not have ""Samsung"" or ""AT&T"" anywhere on the box except a printed out sticker. The original Focus I got from Amazonwireless directly, had a normal flashy orange AT&T box with Samsung written all over it. The product manual inside of this new unlocked phone's box also suspiciously does not say Samsung or AT&T on it. To make matters worse, the little info sticker with the serial numbers on it below the battery does NOT say Samsung on it (unlike our first Samsung Focus directly from Amazonwireless did). When I first got the package, it screamed COUNTERFEIT to me. ***see update below*** But upon opening it, the phone appears to be constructed the same. I powered on and set up the phone and then installed a Benchmark app on it, and it performs the same as my original Focus does. To top it off, I called Samsung directly and told them about my concerns. After describing everything to them and even giving them my phone's IMEI number (serial number), they assured me that it was a genuine Samsung product (but the representative had no explanation for why the packaging looked so suspicious).In any event, the phone itself is a solid 5 stars. AT&T gets 1 star for neglecting their customers by not allowing security and bug fixes on phones they offer (which is partially why we switched carriers in the first place). But because of the update issue and the unusual packaging, I dinged the phone down to 4 stars. But like I said, for an entry-level smart phone WITHOUT extending your contract, you simply cannot beat the price, and the whole Windows Phone system is a wonderfully refreshing alternative to Android and Apple (IMHO).***update*** I received the Focus and it appeared to work perfectly at the time I wrote the original review, but then when we tried to take a picture with the phone a week into owning it, there was a large yellow-discolored area in the center of the screen as if someone tried to take a picture of the sun or something insane like that and burned out the image sensor. That got me thinking that perhaps the phone was refurbished rather than brand new (which might also explain the knock-off looking non-Samsung box). I did some reasearch and have come to the conclusion that I almost certainly received a refurbished phone (an internet search on how to spot refurbished phones was VERY helpful). The seller had good customer service though and sent us a label to send back the defective phone and sent another ""new"" one at no charge. This ""new"" phone was actually in the factory Samsung box this time. However, the box was scratched and the phone itself also had other tell-tale signs of being refurbished (although if I hadn't researched the topic it would have appeared brand new to me). This time around, however, I ran diagnostics on the phone the moment I opened the box and set up the OS and everything seems to be working perfectly. A final follow-up question to the seller about whether they might be getting supplied with refurbished phones instead of ""new"" phones from their supplier has so far gone unanswered, but I'm almost positive that's what is happening here. I can't be too mad because the price we paid for the supposedly ""new"" phone was actually less than other sellers were charging for a refurbished phone, but a little bit of honesty here would be nice. In any event, I encourage you to research how to spot a refurbished phone on the interet for more information. In my non-expert opinion, in retrospect, I highly doubt any carrier-branded phone (i.e. with AT&T logo on the front) can come factory unlocked. So if you see a listing for ""unlocked"" and ""new"" in the same sentence, I personally doubt the accuracy of that listing and urge you to contact the seller in advance to double check. When phones come back from the factory after service work, or they get refurbished to be resold, it is a well-documented fact that they are usually unlocked at THAT point. So be forewarned, if a carrier-branded phone is ""new"" it is most likely locked, and if a carrier-branded phone is unlocked, it is most likely not new. I have lowered the rating down to 3 stars due to what I think is likely inaccurate marketing.","339","Samsung","8"

"6947","Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)","29.99","3","While this phone came out a couple of years ago, it's still a serviceable smart phone if you're not looking for the latest and greatest. If you are looking for something more fully fleshed out I would recommend either the latest Android or iPhone. I did notice some glaring omission/annoyance from this OS and Windows Phone 8 so I'll list the positive and the negatives below.Pros: 1. relatively cheap smart phone 2. Upgradable to Windows Phone 7.5 maybe eventually 7.8 3. Light weight 4. Good wifi receptionCons: 1. Cannot block calls/numbers. (I can't understand why this basic feature isn't present. It's on my 3yr old dumb candy bar phone and yet there's no way to do this either under Windows phone OS or apps. 2. Cannot customize alerts with SMS/MMS or voicemails 3. Battery is weak. A fully charge battery with battery saver feature turned on and in idle mode will last a little over 2 days.Those are pretty much my take on the phone.","339","Samsung","8"

I had to disable some of the features to get more out of the battery. The material make up the phone is cheap, this phone would be better if it was an android phone instead of windows. You will have to format the phone with the memory card to get it recognize your memory card.The vibration is low :(I would recommend this phone","339","Samsung","8"

This has windows 7.5. It takes great pictures, although the camera has a small dark spot and everytime I take a picture, there is a small dark spot in every photo, I have learned to live with it since I dont take much pictures. It has a durable and strong screen. After a year of using it, it started giving me problems were it would freeze and turn off on its own constantly for several weeks. I had to reset the phone to its original settings, I had to lost all my apps, photos, videos etc. Phone works fine now, but I am being more careful with what i download since I think that is what caused it to malfunction. I was able to restored all my contacts since they are link to my email account. Not the photos or apps, those I had to restore again. I am using the pohone with simple mobile, I was told by simple mobile that since the phone it is an AT&T brand, it is the reason I cannot send photos vis msn, because there is something the at&t brand had block and cannot be unlocked. That if I connect the phone with at&t I would be able to send photos via msn. For the same reason I cannot use the phone's integrated gps. In other words 5 functions that comes with the phone you cannot use them unless you connected with at&t. But you can work your way around it if you just download the right app. I use whatsapp to be able to send pictures and a gps app I downloaded.","339","Samsung","8"

Now I can get more apps and some phone functions are now performed in a more efficient way. I know that some persons have concerns because they believe that updating the OS could ""lock"" the phone. In my experience the ""unlock condition"" was not impacted and the phone is now running with the last phone Windows version. I am using this phone with a Mexico SIM card (Telcel) and is functioning perfect. I also tested it with a SIM card of USA and worked fine too.

I really liked the Blackberry but needed a new phone with a bigger screen. I compared the iPhone 4S, 5 and the Galaxy Ace 2, and Galaxy SII. The iPhones just didn't do it for me. After you weed through all the hype, its a smartphone that is more trendy than useful. At over $600 for 4S and $800 for the 32GB iPhone 5, it was too costly for the features included. The SII was too large to fit comfortably in my hand and felt like a small tablet. The Ace 2 had all the features I needed at a reasonable price. I've had the phone for 2 weeks and have no complaints. Would definitely recommend over iPhone.","245","Samsung","8"

"7073","Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 i8160 Black Factory Unlocked 4GB 5MP Droid","99.98999999999999","2","I bought this phone about six weeks ago, the first 4 weeks it worked smoothly, I was very happy with my purchase and I thought I had found a great replacement for my old Iphone, but then, about two weeks ago, I felt asleep and I didn't charge my phone like I usually do. The next morning when I woke up the battery was dead, it wouldn't charge anymore and Im sure it was the battery because I have a friend with the same phone and I tried her battery in my phone and the phone worked. I left it connected to the power for about eight hours straight and nothing. I had to put the battery in a plastic bag and in the freezer for 10 minutes (an old trick I learned from my dad) and it worked. I haven't had any problems with the battery in these two weeks, but I'm scared it might happen again, I have to be very careful not to let the phone run out of power and carry the charger with me at all times.Then, about a week ago I started to have problems with the camera too. It says it has some sort of error. I have to shut down the phone, take the battery off and turn it on again in order for the camera to work (my friend, the one that has the same phone has the very same problem) This can happen once or twice a day and it gets REALLY ANNOYING!.I've read that the update to jellybean is coming soon. I really hope this is true and that these problems will be fixed with the new software. I live across seas and I can't afford to send it back or to exchange it.------------------------------------------------ESPAÑOL----------------------------------------------------------------------Compré este teléfono hace 6 semanas aproximadamente, las primeras 4 semanas funcionó de maravilla, pero hace como 2 semanas me quedé dormida y no lo puse a cargar como normalmente hago. En la mañana cuando me desperté la pila estaba muerta, no cargaba y el teléfono no prendía. Estoy segura que era un problema con la pila porque tengo una amiga que tiene el mismo teléfono y probé poner su pila en mi teléfono y funcionó. Lo dejé cargando como por 8 horas y nada. Al final, tuve que poner la batería en una bolsa plástica en el freezer y funcionó (un viejo truco que aprendí de mi papa). No he vuelto a tener problemas desde ese día, pero tengo que estar pendiente de que el celular no se descargue completamente de nuevo y llevar el cargador conmigo a donde quiera que vaya.Después de eso, hace como una semana, empecé a tener problemas con la cámara. Me sale un mensaje diciendo que hay un error. Tengo que apagar el celular, quitarle la batería y volverlo a prender para que funcione la cámara. A mi amiga, la que tiene el mismo teléfono, le pasa exactamente lo mismo. A veces esto puede pasar una o dos veces al día, y es un verdadero FASTIDIO.Leí por ahí que la actualización a jellybean viene pronto, de verdad espero que esto sea cierto y que con la actualización se corrijan estos errores. No vivo en Estados Unidos y no puedo pagar para devolverlo y no puedo cambiarlo en mi país porque la garantía no lo cubre.","245","Samsung","8"

He doesnt like complicated devices and this was pretty straight forward and easy to use. It was unlocked like I asked for it to be.

"7076","Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 i8160 Black Factory Unlocked 4GB 5MP Droid","99.98999999999999","2","To begin with, this is a very sleek phone with an easy to grasp operating system. The phone itself is light but seems sturdy and well-built. Button placement is logical with crisp actions. However, performing operations beyond dialing on this phone is tedious. If you have ever owned an old computer on which you installed the latest operating system, you know what I mean. Having more than one user application open at any given time noticeably slows the entire system. Make the mistake of using two or more relatively tame applications at the same time and you are likely to freeze the entire system. I put most of the blame on how Android treats background operations, but the phone hardware is equally liable.Skip this phone and get an older iPhone or perhaps the Galaxy S2.","245","Samsung","8"

"7104","Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 i8160 Black Factory Unlocked 4GB 5MP Droid","99.98999999999999","5","This is a very nice phone. It is just as represented. I purchased it for my wife. It arrived in less than a week with standard shipping. The phone was packaged in its original factory retail packaging (nice, elegant, white box), and sealed with all the usual original factory seals still intact with no evidence of ever being opened before. This was evident when you opened the box an saw how nicely everything was packaged. This is why I like buying items that are fulfilled by Amazon.Performance: The phone is very fast and the screen is extremely responsive, besides being very bright and sharp, with great colors. Screen changes and menu navigation is very fast. You can really tell the difference with its dual core processor performance. The WiFi set up in my home was intuitive, it went quickly and very smoothly. It did the hand shake with my wireless modem/router right away and asked me for the key. The WiFi speed is much, much faster than the Galaxy GT-S5360 that I currently own for myself. It was also nice to have the Micro SD card slot accessible from the side of the phone instead of having to open the back cover. The only reason you'll have to open the back cover is to insert the SIM card and/or to get to the battery. Also, this phone's performance in synchronizing with Samsung KIES is way faster than my GT-S5360.The camera photo quality is very satisfactory for a cell phone. Even interior pictures with natural light were good. Just make sure you give a brief moment of time for the auto focus to do it's job. The front VGA video camera seemed to by fine also.Don't worry about some comments from people indicating that it came with a foreign language. It doesn't matter. The minute you start the phone, the very first screen that pops up contains the language selection box, with a drop-down menu. It displays the current language. To change it, simply click on it and scroll down the drop-down menu and select the language that you wish to use. The language selections are written in their native spelling, so it's super easy to spot the desired language by anyone. In my case, I scrolled down to ""English"" and that was it. Immediately thereafter all the set up screens popped up in English. They also provided a small 2-prong US adapter for the European charger. It's handy to have the European charger if you ever travel to Europe, as we sometimes do. The charger itself is universal, so it will work worldwide with the right adapter.Don't forget to order your SD card and protective case cover at the same time so as to save on freight. Also, you'll need the SD card to get started with syncing and other activities, so it's good to have it at the same time.Cons: So far we haven't experienced anything that we didn't like, but we'll update if we do.","245","Samsung","8"

I was afraid it would not be as fast because it has an earlier version of Android, but that is not the case. I hardly have trouble with this phone, it doesn't lag as expected from phones with earlier Android versions. I am still considering whether to update or not since it is working so well for me as it is. Internet is fast, apps run smoothly and I can make basic phone calls and text. I have taken few pictures with it and have not explored all of the settings yet to see how well it works. But I am not expecting professional photos. It is after all, just a phone. In that case you might as well just use a regular camera.","245","Samsung","8"

Both my siblings say that the phone freezes a lot and that's why they rate it a 3. Otherwise, they like the look and build but their apps don't run as smoothly as they would like. To be fair, the price was less and we knew we weren't buying the latest phone. A couple of teens that are constantly on social media apps and listen to music on YouTube and Radio apps, they expect something faster and more up to date without the constant skipping and freezing from the phone.However, it gets a 2 because the specifications on here says the phone comes with 4GB of internal memory and that is not the case - it came with 2GB. It was too late when we noticed this but I was very disappointed.This phone would be fine for very basic usage of data - it's operating system doesn't seem to support much data processing at once. So maybe this phone would be more suitable for people who need basic email and a couple of other apps - no more than that. Overall, the Samsung Ace 2 gets a 2.","245","Samsung","8"

I wanted a phone with a flash and a foward facing camera. I came across a few but this one stuck out. I also needed a unlocked phone because I have pre-paid. I was very nervous because I've never owned a unlocked phone before and wasn't sure what to expect. I literally read every review for this phone *the English reviews because I speak only minor Spanish*. I weighed the negative to the postive and decided to order it. It came a day early and I tracked it so I would know when it was in my city. I waited 3 hours outside for the mail man, THAT is how much I wanted to go ahead and try this phone! I opened the box expecting something used or not right *the negative reviews scared me alittle lol*. But..everything was BRAND NEW!!!! It came with the phone *of course*, Charger, a European charger, and even earbuds for the phone. This phone is light but it runs VERY good! I did have to download a app to allow me to use MMS on my phone because it is a unlocked phone and I have AT&T. It's a free app and now I can send pictures and receive them now. The camera on the phone is very vivid. The flash is BRIGHT lol but thats what I wanted! The foward facing camera words very good as well. Both camera's seem to take High Resolution pictures. The phone came and looked exactly like the picture. You do get to set the language if you need to ""it was on European English when it first turned on, English, United States is right under it"". I synced my Google Account to it and everything else was tooken care of. The call quality is great and so is the speaker quality. This phone is so amazing! My brother has a iPhone 4 and was impressed with this phone because it's a definite upgrade for me and it was only $206. I'm in love with this phone!!!!!","245","Samsung","8"

"7197","Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 i8160 Black Factory Unlocked 4GB 5MP Droid","99.98999999999999","4","This is a decent phone. I got the white one.Some high lights:Pros:- Screen size is 3.8"". It has multi-touch and screen detailing is crisp. Phone has a compact size.- Run smoothly on decent specs with dual core 800 MHz processor and 4 Gigs of internal memory. (a bit below the 1GHz on some high end phones with this same processor so this phone is probably underclocked for better battery life).- The phone has 768MB of RAM. (a bit below the 1GB on some high end phones).- Front-facing camera for video conferencing!! This gives the ability to skype or video-gtalk. Also gives the ability to add a face unlock app which is really nice.- Mobile Hotstop for tethering; WiFi Direct.- 1500 mAh battery with very good life. The phone will easily take you through the day with average use - I get 30 to 40 hours on a single charge.- microSDHC up to 32 GBCons:- Gingerbread 2.3.6 (Would have liked to see ICS 4.0x on the newer phones coming out this year, I have seen only one reference to possible Android Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0x upgrade)- Maybe the price is a tad high @ $290 and a lower price of $250 would be more competitive.- Camera could be snappier. Hopefully an update would take care of this.Network: Update 12/04/2012- 2G Network GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900- 3G Network:GT I8160 - 900/2100 MHz BandsGT I8160L - 850/1900 MHz BandsNote:Amazon list the phone as GT-I8160 but there are actually two models of this phone which have different 3g bands. I ordered the GT I8160 from Open Group Wireless. Check with the vendor for the model number before you order.Overall:This is a nice phone with internal specs just below some of the high end phones.","245","Samsung","8"

Never got a os update, had software sensor glitch from beginning, some features didn't work. If you purchase a foreign phone keep in mind that US Samsung will not support it in the US since they never distributed it here. 13 months after purchase the keyboard started to fail and it takes 30 sec to a minute to initiate call. Conveniently, I can still listen to my podcast during this delay but it is so much more inconvenient when I don't use a headset, due to the fact that you never know when it will put the call thru. I have also had duplicate calls put thru, when trying to figure out what was wrong, I pushed the send call twice. I have reset the phone in hopes of repairing the problem with no luck. Also found no fixes posted online. No recent apps loaded that could cause problem. Shopping for new phone. Shortest phone life ever!","209","Samsung","8"

"7263","Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 i8160 International Version No Warranty, Factory Unlocked (Black)","150.15","4","I purchased this phone to use in South America, and yes the previous reviews are true this is the GL-I8160L version of the phone. Which as of this writing of this review, the phone has a official Jelly Bean 4.1.2 update that has been released for this phone model. You can update the phone to Jelly Bean using the Orion loader and the official Jelly Bean update from Samsung-updates website by looking up the exact model number and version. no need to do a lot of crazy configurations or loading custom pit files. I tried updating the phone via KIES software and Over the Air firmware update on the phone itself but was not able too. However once I manually updated the phone it has really been a far more up to date experience than the stock android 2.3.6 Ginger Bread experience which was pretty fast but it lacked the compatibly to do video on Instagram and run newer version of popular apps. The battery life on the phone is pretty good and the over Jelly Bean experience is really smooth. The phone is perfect for travel since it is factory unlocked and it does not attract too much attention to thief's overseas. The best part is the price and power of phone is close to that of the Samsung Galaxy S3 mini. For a budget buyer and world traveler this phone is great. It does almost everything essential that your Galaxy S3 or S4 does but in a smaller package. I would recommend this phone for people who are also looking to upgrade their old outdated phones for a affordable unlocked phone.","209","Samsung","8"

I would give it 5 stars except it keeps switching between networks for some reason, and since I am only on one network when it switches I lose signal and data. Carried it to my local phone company where they were trying to tell me that the phone was no good. Good thing I am one of those people who likes to open up settings and see whats what. Come to find out that the phone kept on switching between GSM and CDMA and that's why service was up and down. Since the default was GSM/CDMA my phone company just put it on GSM only and I have been having less problems since then. It keeps asking for my okay for hand configuration, and the phone does not exactly snap completely closed, but they are minor annoyances not worth returning the phone for. Other than that, its a great phone. Looking forward to seeing what all it can do.","209","Samsung","8"

It's in perfect condition and fully functional, no problems to activate with the operator. I'm quite pleased with this cell phone because it has many improvements over version S5830 (ACE), in terms of speed (since it is dual core), ergonomics, screen and graphics, also has more storage memory for applications (rather negative aspect in the ACE version). I like a lot the performance of this phone regarding this range and price, and compared to other brands of the same range (like Sony Xperia Miro) is excellent. His design is very attractive and has some similarity to the Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini (Samsung Galaxy I8190) and is a bit thinner than the ACE. I have to confess something I did not like, is that the camera shutter to capture photos is quite delayed, however the image quality is very good. Another negative thing is that the phone did not come with a Micro SD card, maybe no longer manufactures are coming as well. In general terms it is very good phone for the price it handles, has usually what you need and performs quite well.","209","Samsung","8"

"7331","Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 i8160 International Version No Warranty, Factory Unlocked (Black)","150.15","4","I really like this phone. So far it hasn't given me any troubles. It works perfectly with DIGITEL in Venezuela.The cons I actually see on the phone are:1.- The camera is pretty slow. it takes too long to take the shot and you have probably lost the moment you wanted to capture, plus there's no zoom.2.- The notifications don't appear when you're playing a game. for example: when I'm playing song pop, the phone rings but doesn't show the notification.3.- The alarm clock is a bit complicated. You need to go into the clock, then go to alarm clock , then go to alarm and THEN create the alarm. I think it could be way more simple if there was a direct acces to the alarm clock, but you can't create it.4.- The front camera could have better resolution.5.- the LED light doesn't blink. Weird because a friend of mine has the GALAXY S II and hers doesn't blink either, so it seems more of a GALAXY issue.But despite of those things, I think this phone is great. It's all about getting used to the phone and I'm very happy with it.","209","Samsung","8"

Before buying, i contacted them to be sure that the model offered (GT-I8160L) was compatible with my operator's 3G data service and it was!. Please beware that there are two models for the Ace 2 where the only difference is the 3G band compatibility.Model ------- 3G Bands supportGT-I8160 ---- 900/2100 MHz (Digitel in Venezuela for example. Most operators in Europe use these bands).GT-I8160L --- 850/1900 MHz (AT&T in USA, Movilnet/Movistar in Venezuela for example. Most operators in the american continent use these bands).At first blush the phone seems to perform great. Nice screen and resolution, android gingerbread (ICS comming soon) and vga front camera.

"7359","Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 i8160 International Version No Warranty, Factory Unlocked (Black)","150.15","1","Without a doubt, this has to be the worst piece of electronic technology I have ever bought. I make this statement on the concept of something doing what it is supposed to do. The Commodore 16 was fantastic at what it did for what it was supposed to do. This phone is garbage. It barely works. It is slow. It consistently locks up and has to be restarted.Everytime I see how fast someone else's phone switches applications i get angry at my phone.The antenna is terrible. This phone does not receive a signal in places where every other phone I see does. The good thing is that I can't have my head in the phone instead of watching my little boy play.By the numbers it looked like a good deal. Perhaps the pice was low because the manufacturer knew it barely works.Stay away from this piece of barely working %$#%!!!!I've been meaning to write this review for a long time.","209","Samsung","8"

T-Mobile uses the 1700/2100 mhz frequency for their 3G network. You need the phone to support BOTH frequency in order to get 3G. Maybe AT&T supports the frequencies on this phone. Check with carrier before buying! I had to return this and get a different phone. Also, if you want the NFC enabled phone, make sure to get the i8160P version. P=NFC...no P means no NFC.

"7397","Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 i8160 International Version No Warranty, Factory Unlocked (Black)","150.15","1","I purchased this phone on the 30th of August, and received it about a month later. When I finally received it, it starting giving problems almost within the first week. After less than 2 months, it has been shutting itself down at random times, such as during a phone call, or even when I simply touch the screen. The battery life depletes very quickly,I charged it fully and after a few hours it's dead, even if I don't do much with it (eg no wifi, no blutooth etc). I am very disappointed, I tried to return it LESS THAN TWO MONTHS after I purchased it and the seller curtly informed me, INCORRECTLY that it was over 2 months and I could no longer return the phone. I don't know if she is on another planet where the months are less than 30 days or what, but I am EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED, I would NOT recommend this product. Do NOT buy this phone from this seller!!For the customer service and the defective product I would have to give one star, although it deserves zero stars.

"7409","Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 i8160 International Version No Warranty, Factory Unlocked (Black)","150.15","4","This is my first smartphone and I have had it for a couple of days only, so I have not fully used the android applications available. The touch screen has good response. There are apps for Google Gmail, Google Talk, Youtube, Map, Google+, Voice Talk, Talk, Yahoo mail , News & weather, voice recorder, camera, voice command, FM Radio, Navigation, music hub, social hub, gallery,calendar, internet, google search, downloads, photo editor, messenger, Task Manager, Samsung Apps that provides a lot of options to download more apps etc.... The calls are loud and clear and I could check my emails via Wifi without needing a data SIM card. Yahoo mail looked better in the android phone as it showed attached images in small preview in the inbox view. The cell phone also downloaded some SW patches and applied after Wifi was setup. The GPS is good, have not tried the navigation feature. The Camera does not have a Zoom feature. Hoping to use the talk app to make free calls over free wifi (home, airport etc)Update July 13---------------Its been a couple of months now. I am still using the phone for making/receiving important calls or when I am away from a landline... not doing much browsing and have not used Google chat yet. I use Whatsapp app for chat which is free and good. Have not downloaded any apps.I feel I could have got a mobile with larger LCD screen size and higher resolution camera 8 Mp.But those occasions when I miss higher resolution camera are few.....would have been good to have, if not for the high price of such phones. Basically the camera size is correct size for carrying in my pocket, making routine my phone calls, to check my company stock symbol once in a while. to read news online when on free wifi ..... occasional use. mine is a T-mobile prepaid plan... I have accessed online webpage for Google search, travel directions, hotels etc... while traveling. not sure if this was over 3g etc. but web page was slow... possibly due to my prepaid plan. I anyways do not use browser much on the road other than when on wireless networks that are free.I would like to upgrade the mobile to ICE CREAM sandwich android version.

Decent memory, ram, dual core processor, all of which works pretty well. While the phone may not be butter smooth like a high end model, it offers many of the same functionalities.A weak point for me with this model is the internal memory. While it is 4GB, most of this is taken up by the OS, leaving only a little over 1GB for storage. A problem arises as you start loading up apps. You quickly run out of space, and apparently (I've checked forums) even if you select the external memory card data is stored in the USB storage. Go figure.Other than this, the phone is pretty solid and I would recommend this purchase if you are not looking for the same features as a high end smart phone.","209","Samsung","8"

"7423","Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 i8160 International Version No Warranty, Factory Unlocked (Black)","150.15","5","I've had this phone for about half a year now and I do not intend to change it. It's a good size (I don't like my phone being too big), light, fast and versatile. The battery holds charge for a day or two depending on how much I use it and I do a lot of browsing (over wi fi), email and facebook. The camera is solid (for a phone camera) and the sound quality is really good, both during conversation and music reproduction (I listen to the built in FM radio and MP3s fairly often). The only thing I don't like about it is that it tries to synchronize everything by default, i.e., it wants to merge my phone contacts with my gmail, facebook & skype contacts (oh, the skype app works great on it and the, albeit lower quality, front camera is great for it) which I don't care for (call me old fashioned, but I like to keep my contacts separate). Overall, I'm really satisfied with my purchase since I got a lot of features for a lot less money than if I'd bought something like an iPhone or a Galaxy SIII. I've also successfully used it in the US (on T Mobile & currently AT&T) as well as on various networks in Europe.","209","Samsung","8"

"7439","Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 i8160 International Version No Warranty, Factory Unlocked (Black)","150.15","2","The first thing this phone taught me is that Samsung is overrated in the first place. Never got a os update, had software sensor glitch from beginning, some features didn't work. If you purchase a foreign phone keep in mind that US Samsung will not support it in the US since they never distributed it here. 13 months after purchase the keyboard started to fail and it takes 30 sec to a minute to initiate call. Conveniently, I can still listen to my podcast during this delay but it is so much more inconvenient when I don't use a headset, due to the fact that you never know when it will put the call thru. I have also had duplicate calls put thru, when trying to figure out what was wrong, I pushed the send call twice. I have reset the phone in hopes of repairing the problem with no luck. Also found no fixes posted online. No recent apps loaded that could cause problem. Shopping for new phone. Shortest phone life ever!","209","Samsung","8"

"7452","Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 i8160 International Version No Warranty, Factory Unlocked (Black)","150.15","4","I purchased this phone to use in South America, and yes the previous reviews are true this is the GL-I8160L version of the phone. Which as of this writing of this review, the phone has a official Jelly Bean 4.1.2 update that has been released for this phone model. You can update the phone to Jelly Bean using the Orion loader and the official Jelly Bean update from Samsung-updates website by looking up the exact model number and version. no need to do a lot of crazy configurations or loading custom pit files. I tried updating the phone via KIES software and Over the Air firmware update on the phone itself but was not able too. However once I manually updated the phone it has really been a far more up to date experience than the stock android 2.3.6 Ginger Bread experience which was pretty fast but it lacked the compatibly to do video on Instagram and run newer version of popular apps. The battery life on the phone is pretty good and the over Jelly Bean experience is really smooth. The phone is perfect for travel since it is factory unlocked and it does not attract too much attention to thief's overseas. The best part is the price and power of phone is close to that of the Samsung Galaxy S3 mini. For a budget buyer and world traveler this phone is great. It does almost everything essential that your Galaxy S3 or S4 does but in a smaller package. I would recommend this phone for people who are also looking to upgrade their old outdated phones for a affordable unlocked phone.","209","Samsung","8"

Come to find out that the phone kept on switching between GSM and CDMA and that's why service was up and down. Since the default was GSM/CDMA my phone company just put it on GSM only and I have been having less problems since then. It keeps asking for my okay for hand configuration, and the phone does not exactly snap completely closed, but they are minor annoyances not worth returning the phone for.

"7458","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","My previous phone was an iPhone 4 which I got for the ecosystem/iLife compatibility with my MacBook Pro. This phone looks and functions like a value version of the iPhone. Whereas the iPhone has a solidity and style that belongs in a design museum, the Exhibit II 4G feels more like a beautiful everyday object, one that, when dropped, inspires irritation rather than panic. The two phones are actually very close in terms of general hardware features, notably the mini-tablet shape, size of the screen, image quality, bi-directional camera, and other smaller details. (It is very easy to see why Apple had filed a lawsuit against Samsung for imitation.) The biggest adjustment personally has been switching from the buttery smooth responsiveness of the iPhone touchscreen to the entirely functional, but uninspiring, Exhibit screen. Otherwise, I am extremely pleased with the range of apps, built-in Swype and voice texting, crystal clear Wi-Fi calling (useful for an occasionally spotty T-Mobile network). Ultimately the decision is whether a great iPhone is worth $60 a month more in subscription fees than a (very) good Exhibit. AT&T and T-Mobile offering a comparable service, we past and present iPhone users are essentially paying an extra $720 a year to remain in the exclusive Apple ecosystem. What's an iLife worth to you?","990","Samsung","8"
"7459","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","I just bought this item to get the T-mobile 30$ unlimited 100 mn plan.Item came really fast within 2 days (with free super saving). I'm writing how to activate the plan as some people had trouble with that apparentlyThe activation of the 30$ plan is straightforward (if you are a new customer, I don't care to get a new phone number but apparently people have trouble to switch their old number to this plan. It is aimed to attract new customers...) just go there[...]and enter your informations and the activation informations (activation card on the document inside the box + info at the bottom of the box or check the sim card and the phone battery). Just follow the instructions (pay 30$, etc)For the phone activation, I had more trouble. After your plan is activated (and paid) you will get an email. Use the information on the mail to activate your phone. There are probably several ways to do it (call T-mobile ?). For me, I went there[...]and followed a step by step process (add an info written on the email they just send you, click continue, enter info on the next box)When you are done, your phone is activated BUT will do nothing useful until you reboot (took me forever to find out...)About the phone, I was using a prepaid blackberry plan and the T-mobile 4G makes a huge difference (I don't live in a big city, got one or two bars usually). When I drop on edge, it is like my old blackberry.It is extremely slippery, I just bought a protective skin to get a better grasp. I would not recommend to use it without protection as it will probably fall from your hands at some point. The touch screen is an interesting experience for a blackberry user. I am using it on the side to get a bigger keyboard. Overall, I would say for a new user like me, the screen reacts as expected 80-90% of the time (other time, you mispell, click the wrong link, etc)The number of apps is amazing and a decent number can probably be downloaded on the device without a memory card. I just ordered a memory card but it is because I am planning to use it as an mp3 player and store music on it (sound quality sounds good to me).I had no memory left after getting facebook and google map on my blackberry so I could not use it to do a lot of things. I am just scratching the surface but I believe I will have a much better experience and flexibility with this device.Battery life does not look really high using the default settings. It is one day max for me just discovering what the device can do. It can probably be improved by tuning the settings or by downloading the good app. It is approximatively what I had with my blackberry (and I was using it less often).Overall a really good experience. It is cheaper and better than what I was paying for. I rate it 4 stars because I've no idea how durable the device is. I would go 4.5 stars if it was possible. If it lasts more than one year, what I save every month with this new plan will have paid for the phone and it will deserve much more than 5 stars.EDIT: apparently I cannot write links on the review... The first one would be the one you would get typing on google something like T-mobile + activation. The second one is the link written on the activation card (among the 3 ways to activate the phone).","990","Samsung","8"

I haven't had any troubles running programs yet and in the few videos I have pulled up on the internet played without any problems. There has been a couple hesitations when trying to switch between windows but it definitely is not the norm. I am impressed with the interface that Samsung has put on the phone.

"7470","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","2","FYI: I have had this phone for less than 1 week.I havent been totally displeased with this phone (but I cant bring myself to give it 3 stars). It is quick, the screen has pretty crisp images/good resolution and colors (depending on what you are used to), the camera is good (not great), and the Samsung interface is better than vanilla Android in my opinion (adding shortcuts/widgets to the homescreen for example). However, this phone has been freezing a LOT (also..the pull down notification bar often wont stick/stay down, it just goes back up, the call volume could be a little louder, and the signal ability seems slightly weaker than other phones). Basically, it freezes once or twice with every 20 minutes (straight) of use. And it was like that even when I barely had any apps downloaded onto it. To make matters worse, it doesnt just pick up where it left off after a few minutes of me waiting...it concludes by restarting itself! This is usually not a big deal but I have worked on school papers via phone before and I would hate for it to shut down during a time like that. Such an issue just doesnt make the phone feel dependable. Im considering returning this phone.If it matters to you...the freeze ups are not during gaming or watching movies...they are during simpler things like clicking on something (or just the Back button) within the first 1 or 2 screens of an app. Neither Home nor Back work. Not even volume (oh, that freezes up too by the way...when there is no other freezing going on.) The only button that works is the lock screen/power button but it only provides the on/off screen, not any actual locking or powering down during the freeze.Tiny gripe: I wish there was some other way to turnt he screen on other than just by the somewhat stiff, high-up button on the right-hand side. Its not a convenient spare fo the moment location. The phone is a *little* awkward to hold/not narrow enough and I dont have short fingers. The plus of the power/lock button being high is carefree placement in a car mount, but its just high up enough to not be a comfy location. The volume button is a little lower and no problem.Tethering - at least as is - does not work, but I dont fault the phone for that (but I wanted to let you know what to expect). I am quite sure it is due to T-Mobile now charging (monthly add-on) for Wifi and USB tethering. I havent had any problems with bluetooth connectivity.","990","Samsung","8"

However there are three things that are annoying with the phone that other people do not comment on. One is that the text messaging does not work that comes with the phone and you have to download a separate app to make it work properly. The other annoyance is that the phone freezes and resets once in a while. I've read that you can root the phone and after uninstalling the T-Mobile apps the second problem will go away. Lastly 512mb isnt that much memory and unless you know how to clean the memory it may run slow.That said the phone is really great. It is small. I've clocked downloads on T-Mobile as fast as 6-8 megabits per second (depends on where you live). Very customizable and functional. Knowing what I do know now, I would still get the phone as it does get the job done once you download the right apps.I'm sure other apps can solve the problems.

"7481","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","*** UPDATE ***T-Mobile updated the firmware on this phone to Android 2.3.6. The difference is huge! My review below reflects on my experience using Android 2.3.5. Most of the issues have been resolved. While the phone still lacks memory, it manages it much better now. Instead of running out of memory and crashing all the time, the phone will now close unused applications before that happens. It also feels much snappier overall. For some reason though, the phone had somewhat better reception using the old firmware, taking off a star.*** END UPDATE ***The Samsung Exhibit II 4G could be a real game changer for prepaid phones. Unlike almost every prepaid phone out there, it has a high resolution 480x800 screen, runs Android 2.3.5 and has a fast 1GHz processor. Alas, Samsung did not want this phone to become a viable alternative to its far more expensive Galaxy S line and equipped this phone with not enough memory to truly give you all the benefits of a smart phone.First off, there are many things to like. The screen is bright with vibrant colors and crisp text thanks to its higher resolution. The included 3MP camera makes great pictures, comparable to regular 3MP cameras back when they were popular. I especially like that the phone does not compress the pictures too much like many other phones, leaving the pictures largely free of visible artifacts. I had a 5MP Nokia with Zeiss optics, but the pictures on this 3MP phone look WAY better. The reception is also excellent, even in difficult locations, such as on the Staten Island Ferry. This phone does not lose signal for the duration of the trip, unlike some other phones. Don't expect good data connection though when the signal is poor. Finally, you can use this phone with any T-Mobile sim card. T-Mobile offers discounted plans if you don't require a subsidized phone. This prepaid version costs much less than MSRP but will still work with your existing T-Mobile sim card.Sadly, the phone also has some major drawbacks, the biggest one being a lack of RAM. The phone advertises 512MB of RAM, but only 356MB are accessible. Preloaded and system apps take up the bulk of available memory, leaving you with about 100MB of available RAM, give or take, at any given time. If you like apps, that's not enough. Many apps, including the most popular ones like words with friends, install services that run in the background. They can use easily 6-40MB each. Download 4 Zynga games and you are out of RAM. Once the phone runs out of RAM, it slows down and crashes. Forget multi-tasking. The app widget which lets you close applications and free RAM will become your best friend.You could root this phone and remove some useless T-Mobile apps to free up some RAM but that would void your warranty and probably not help a whole lot. If the phone had 1GB of RAM, it would have been perfect.Overall, this can be a great phone if you want a smart phone but do not plan on installing many apps. If you want a phone that can truly take advantage of a high resolution screen and a snappy processor, this one is not it.","990","Samsung","8"

You do have to get a sim card from straight talk to use it on the network and they cost about $15 dollars. I will have to say that they do come with a lot of apps and I have downloaded some also so the battery life is not as long as I would wish but I just recharge it and all is fine. I highly recommend this phone. On the straight talk network the cost is $45 a month with unlimited talk, text, and internet I am over the moon. I even downloaded words with friends so I am always hooked up. For the money a great phone.","990","Samsung","8"
"7485","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","This phone was my first experience with Android. It certainly has lots of bells and whistles. And it certainly is a much better phone in terms of hardware and software than the iPhone. However, I returned this phone within 4 days of having it for a number of reasons:1) I need a phone that is reliable, durable, and functional for traveling. This phone does not do that. It has only 3G service in North America and some parts of South America. It does not have 3G service in Europe, Asia, or Africa.2) The phone is nowhere near as durable as a Blackberry. Not even close. Though it is much more durable than an iPhone. Unless you are in the habit of replacing your phone every 6 months because a new trinket catches your eye, this phone will not last 3 years of use and abuse. The screen will crack, the camera will scratch, etc. Nothing new here that iPhone users will not be accustomed to.3) With a fully charged battery, I left the phone on idle with it only connected to the 3G network for cellular phone service (no data). The battery was dead in 18 hours. Totally dead. I can leave my Blackberry in the same configuration for 10 days without any worries. This battery issue alone is enough to disqualify this phone for serious use.4) It is basically impossible to sync Outlook with the Android contacts/calendar. The only way is to sync Outlook with GMail servers, and then sync that with Android. This means that you must be ok with allowing Google to have access to all your contacts, calendar, and whatever else you are syncing. I think this is a huge breech of privacy.As far as I can see, this is probably the best Android phone on the market in terms of size, usability, price, etc. But like the iPhone, it is simply not ready for serious users. Just a toy.","990","Samsung","8"

Her phone just works so well and has a bright screen and good battery life, 'tho she does not place as much demands (gps, Bluetooth, etc as I do). She primarily uses it as an e-reader for books. The android phone and our android tablet sync as she switched from one to another to read. She also emails and texts and phones. We both use T-mobile pre-paid and mostly our home wi-fi to keep cost of data down. she has used about $100 in 10 months of ownership, I use about $100 in 3 months by buying 1 days worth of data as I need to travel to non-wi-fi areas or anticipate more than 20 minutes in a day of phone calls.","990","Samsung","8"

Hard to handle without starting programs you don't want. the phone failed after less than a month. there is poor tech support.

After only a month? so i did and it worked for only another week then the same thing. i called tech support again( a very long process!!)so they told me to send only the phone, no memory card, no back cover, no battery back to them and they would repair it. 3 weeks later it arrived and it still did not work!!! they then told me to send in the battery. (DUH) its been a week, no battery. I'm still waitingThe other issue is cell service.(t-Mobile) poor to none. although i'm in a strong coverage area according to their map. after repeated calls they informed me that i wasn't supposed to get coverage in a building? what were they thinking?

"7498","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","3","I bought this phone to sign up with T-Mobile Monthly-4G $30 plan (unlimited data, text and 100 minutes talk). The T-Mobile plan is great, if I am rating T-Mobile plan I will give it 5-star. However this is about the phone itself, it's just OK in my opinion. Some Pros and ConsPros:(1) It is running Android, there are about half million apps in the Android Market, the first 2 I downloaded are PDANet for tethering and Talkatone for free IP calling, both work.(2) The phone has a powerful processor which makes all the applications run fast.(3) The price is quite affordable compared to other Android 4G smartphonesCons:(1) The battery life is horrible, for a fully charged phone, the battery will only last about 24 hours. I rarely have more than 5 applications running at the same time and the phone screen is off 90% of the times.(2) For some reason I can not pair the phone with my blue tooth headset, ironically my headset is also a Samsung. I don't have problem pairing the same headset with my iPhone.(3) One minor problem with the default email program, it does not seem to support Yahoo email. I simply download Yahoo Mail App from Android market","990","Samsung","8"
"7499","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","For 4G, it's pretty good. It's a budget smartphone and has a few issues here and there, but it's better than the Optimus T, lol.

"7500","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","First of all, I owned iphones since the first generation using att...somehow I can't justify paying $145 per month and chained to 2yr contracts anymore so I decided to do some research. So far, I find Tmobile to be of decent quality as far as cellular coverage it's not Verizon, Att or Sprint but hey they have the best prepaid plans so far if your looking to budget.The reason I chose this phone was that it gave me all the apps I had on the iphone and more (although on an android platform), it's 4G and you can't beat $30 a month unlimited text, 4g up to 5g web and 100 minutes, (5g is more than enough), and NO contract, the phone is lightweight somewhat of a cheaper quality than the iphone, but then again it's not an iphone but functions just as well...the battery does drain a bit faster but you can get the juice defender to save on battery...don't like the bloatware but I saw in other reviews you can root to remove unwanted apps which is nice if the instructions are followed correctly without bricking the phone...I'm a huge web browser and find this much faster (4g) than my latest iphone 4g...maybe someday I'll return to my beloved iphone but only when prices come down and att stops throttling the data usage.Overall, this phone works great and I'm pleased...no buyers remorse here :) and no complaints with the service Tmobile offers so farPS: Gotta love Amazon, free 2 day shipping and no tax..set up was easy online or you can also call Tmobile","990","Samsung","8"

"7502","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","Let me begin by stating that I am very pleased, overall. This phone is quite the money-saver, really. Its $200 price-tag really sets the bar for phone companies to deliver quality goods at affordable and reasonable prices. The $30/month plan goes perfectly with this phone and I am looking forward to paying for it. 2-day prime shipping was AWESOME! Immediately after opening the box, I set up my Google account and played around with the phone for a while. It was easy to set up and is easily managed and user-friendly.A few things that I noticed that might be a small annoyance are as follows: slightly unresponsive lock screen, no haptic feedback when typing (however, the camera feature has a haptic feature), pre-installed and unremovable apps/games, lack of ambient light sensor function, poor Wifi connection, and a few other small things.However, many of the features are highly commendable, such as the easy set-up, great screen, lightweight physique, pre-installed apps for video chat and wifi calling, etc.For the $200, this phone is DEFINITELY worth it, especially for those seeking to avoid a 2-year contract. This phone is not only great for the price, but actually great.P.S. - I suggest getting some screen protectors and an SD card. The phone has a few gigs of built-in memory, but an SD card will definitely come in handy, such as the 16GB microSD found here on Amazon.","990","Samsung","8"
"7503","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","3","I got this phone about three weeks ago to replace my LG Optimus T. I liked the Optimus T, but felt it was a little laggy when running apps and the screen was smaller than I really wanted. This phone initially seemed perfect: bigger screen, bigger memory, better camera. All of that is true and I really enjoy all of those aspects of the phone.My biggest complaint is the text messaging. The phone, out of box, has some pretty bad texting problems that can be found across the t-mobile board (wish I had seen those earlier!). Messages fail constantly; some messages that fail have more than 160 characters, other are short messages. It took me five minutes to get an ""Ok!"" sent to one of my employees. If this problem didn't exist, this phone would be a 4-star for me, but both Samsung and T-Mobile support don't seem to want to do anything about this problem.","990","Samsung","8"
"7504","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","THE GOOD STUFF. its like mp3 player, a camera and camcorder. i like how i can put the micro SD card in and view my pics from it and listen to my music thats on it. the music can play from the phone loud or you can put a quietly with headphones. it has a good sound recorder. the sound recorder is unlimited amount of time i think. and it has a camera and a video recorder. picture and video quality isnt the best but good enough. the video recorder might be unlimited too until memory runs out.and if you dont use the phone much like me then i also like that i only have to spend $10 every 90 days but i cant use the internet like that. so i could spend $40 every year and not every month like contract phones. huge difference. but this is perfect for me since i very rarley use the phone. some months i dont use a phone at all but i do need it sometimes.NOW THE PROBLEMS. the buttons and screen dont always work correctly. ive had 4 other phones and they all work perfecly but calling and using this phone is a headache. many times i call and want to hang up and cant hang up wasting my minutes. sometimes i call and it freezes on that screen. to many errors. to many buttons i dont click, end up getting clicked somehow. its a horrible idea touch screen. so basically why it gets 2 stars is cuz its not really work if you use it as a phone. almost every phone is better then this part. $198 for a camera and sound recorder and viewing files and music is a rip off. i can use my camera which you can get for under 50 bucks for all that stuff.EDIT: I tired to be to nice, this phone is garbage. change from 2 star to 1 star. this phone does not work compared to most phones","990","Samsung","8"

It's my first smartphone and my first Android OS, but I'm liking almost everything about it. Great call quality and connectivity (important to me!), fast, good battery life, fairly intuitive to use (with modest learning curve). Can do free video calls using Skype when I'm in a wi-fi hotspot, and the call/video quality is good. The camera doesn't take great pics, but it's not an important feature for me. I had to download a couple of apps (keyboard and messaging) to overcome a couple of minor defects in the OS, but it was painless and free. I would recommend this phone to new smartphone users.

"7508","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I got this phone and was really pleased with the overall fit, finish, and feel. It was sleek and not overly flashy. The screen was bright and crystal clear. I did alot of research on T-mobile and coverage areas. On the map, I was covered, and 100% covered by 4G, so I was excited to try it out. I got the phone overnighted from amazon and got it all set up and nothing... No signal and the phone stayed in ""Edge"" data, but couldn't even get on the internet. I could make calls, but not recieve them. I called T-mobile and they said everything was fine, and made a test call, which came through. That was the only call that ever made it through... EVER! So, sadly, the phone went back, and I stayed with Sprint.","990","Samsung","8"
"7509","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I just got the delivery of this phone yesterday, and it took me about 12 mins to set it going.... and yeah, it fully qualifies for the $30 (100 mins + unlimited text and data with 4G speeds for 5GB)... at least it worked for me! I just followed the instructions mentioned in the starter kit and chose this plan on the site. And yes, I bought the phone from Amazon.I have used iPhone 3G in the past, and this one definitely outsmarts the iPhone 3G for sure. I haven't checked out on iPhone4 as yet. But who needs an iPhone4 when most of the features come at one forth of the cost. And, without any contract!The phone is pretty zippy even with a 1Ghz single core processor... definitely not as zippy as Galaxy S2 Skyrocket which runs on a dual-core 1.5 Ghz. Having said that, I am only comparing. The phone is quite fast really!Gingerbread 2.3.5 is simply amazing! There are virtually unlimited Apps available. Samsung TouchWiz UI is very good and intuitive. I love the swipe left/right for message/call feature. Very basic, but so useful!As mentioned by other reviewers, there is quite some bloatware pre-installed on the phone, that one cannot remove (as of now). But, it is definitely not a factor to reject the phone. Some people might just find these useful as well.I haven't connected the phone to my PC as yet and shall update a line or two on the same in some days.I have ordered 32 Gigs of micro sd and will let know how it goes. Per some other reviews, it worked out well.I had charged the battery to full last afternoon and have been doing quite a lot of wi-fi, downloads et all, and yet it has about 28% left. This is where the Exhibit II beats the Skyrocket hands down. The Skyrocket is a battery-drainer, of course due to its larger screen and bigger processor.I am glad that I bought this phone over Galaxy S2, and I would definitely recommend it to someone who does not need a super computer on-the-go and wants to have a decent smartphone with no contract.More updates soon!Update 1 (01/28): Exactly a month's usage, and I am more than happy to have bought this phone. It doubles up as a very decent music player with 32 gigs memory. I would suggest downloading PowerAMP and good in-ear head-phones (J5 JBuds from JLabs is what I use.. they 're neat).On the down side, at times the phone is a bit sluggish when unlocking the phone with pass code. Not that bad since its not that frequent. Also, I don't really use Kies Air to manage and transfer music. I find it ok to use, but am more comfortable just dragging and dropping music folders onto the phone.I have installed quite a number of Apps and all of them have worked excellently on the phone.The voice quality is good, the 4G coverage is very good, at the least in my neighborhood and my work place. Since I have the $30 unlimited data package with first 5GB at 4G, I never really use wi-fi. I guess it improves the battery performance further. I have disabled the 'Background Data' in accounts and sync under settings. I check my emails manually when needed.All in all, I am quite happy with my purchase so far, and I expect it to service me for about 18 months to 2 years at the least.","990","Samsung","8"
"7510","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","After using this phone for a week, I'm favorably impressed. I wanted a small form factor to slip into my pocket. I wanted a removable battery. I wanted to be able to add extra storage. And I wanted to own a smart phone outright without a 2-year contract. I was able to cut our monthly cell phone bill in half for our 2-phone family. This phone has it all! I had been an apple ios5 user, and I'm still keeping my ipad, but I have to admit that this Android OS (gingerbread) is very good. My wife's iphone 4 almost seems old, heavy and clunky next to this. Yes, the phone is plastic and probably won't withstand a hard drop, but neither did the iphone. The rounded corners make it easy to slip into pockets, and if you are worried about it slipping out, buy a silicone cover. I had been a t-mobile user, but I whole-heartedly concur with other reviewers.... t-mo customer service reeks! It's inconsistent, and it took me several phone calls and several days before everything got changed over to the new phones.","990","Samsung","8"

(yeah I did charge it to 100% first.) I registered this thing at Samsung's web site and was shocked to see it only left the factory line 9 days before it was shipped! These arent some warehouse clearance specials, they are brand-new.I tested the 4G where it was available, and it was darn close to 2MBps, faster than my home DSL. I upped my TMobile plan and am looking forward to trying the wireless hotspot. There was no advertising or announcement that TMobile was rolling out 4G here in Central Florida. It works a lot of the main areas, not out in the boonies where I live...Great phone, Android Gingerbread waaaaay faster than Froyo...camera takes great pics, the built-in media player is nice w headphones. Could have come with a better ringtone and wallpaper assortment. The Google Maps GPS gets me in my yard to about a foot of real-life. Sweet.The included data cable didn't allow it to self-install drivers in Windows 7 64-bit, so I downloaded the Samsung New PC Studio (yeah that's what they call it) and then was able to browse the phone and add stuff to my SD card. I got a 32GB one somewhere at 32 bucks...so now I got me a touch-screen Gingerbread MP3 player..that has a 4G phone built in!! for like 170 bucks less than the 32BG IPod. Can't beat that with a stick.One Week UPDATE....okay, it's been a week...the battery last pretty well if u keep a shortcut to Task Manager on the 1 home screen and shut stuff down when you're done.

"7514","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","After less than 1 month of using this phone, we experienced texting issues - essentially texts wouldn't send & we'd get a failure message. A call to T Mobile customer service had us going through all kinds of hoops trying to diagnose the issue & finally the CS just told us to switch our SIM card. We did & the phone worked well for about 1 week. We are now back to texting issues & unable to receive/make phone call issues where we have to power down the phone, wait & power it up again.However, upon looking at the message boards on the T Mobile website, I learned that other people have this same issue & T Mobile has acknowledged the issue, but has not resolved it.<<This is a known issue with this device. Putting the phone on GSM only, as mike_s stated, is a workaround. We ask that you please be patient with us as we work with Samsung to come up with a resolution.>>The T Mobile workaround:I have found a few things that can help you text in the meantime. First, I'd look to uninstall any texting applications that were used during the failures, and if the texts aren't very long, it might help to not allow the phone to switch between 2G/3G networks. This can be done like this; 1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key. 2. Tap Settings. 3. Tap Wireless and Networks. 4. Tap Mobile Networks. 5. Tap Network mode. 6. Tap GSM Only. While it isn't ideal to keep your phone on GSM only (as browsing speeds will be slower and you will need to manually change the network back to get faster data speeds) we have found that short texts on GSM only rarely fail. I hope this temporary workaround finds you well, and know that we will continue to work on this.T-ForcePersonally, I think that patience can only last so long. Apparently, T Mobile has known about this issue since November but has done nothing to fix it nor have they offered a replacement phone to unsatisfied buyers.We really liked this phone, but it is simply unusable if it doesn't allow a user to text. From 5 stars to 1 star.3/8/12: Phone still has texting issues & T-Mobile has done nothing to rectify the issue. You can never tell if the phone's recipient actually received your text & we are still experiencing bouts of text sending failure. We are switching to the Lumia 710 & giving up on this phone. Disappointing. What a waste of money.ORIGINAL POST (LOVED THE PHONE):We are on a T-Mobile family plan & it was time to bring my spouse into the world of smartphones. Since he is hard on his phones, I didn't want to spend a lot of money, but wanted him to have access to email, maps & the other benefits that smartphones provide.The Samsung Exhibit II is an impressive little phone. It is easy to pick up & start using right off the bat. It has swype capability, voice texting & an easy to use/read calendar (voice capability to add an ""event""). There are a ton of nice features packed into this phone & it costs less than half of the ""fancier"" smartphones on the market.We purchased a soft silicone case to start Black Soft Silicone Skin Case Cover for Samsung Exhibit 4G T759 & it fits fine; however, when a more durable case comes available, we will probably upgrade.","990","Samsung","8"

I use the crap out of my phones though so I'm sure it would be great for someone who only uses it for calling, texting, and internet. I do 3D modeling on mine. Just kidding, that would be outrageous and very difficult. I do use it for navigation, Pandora, Instagram, Hill Climb Racing, internet, texting, calling, and general jagaloonery. The camera isn't bad. I do wish it had an auto dimming/brightening feature for the screen, but just download a widget that lets you adjust it and you're fine. I don't understand why you have to press ""OK"" after entering your PIN to unlock it, but whatever. Oh also it's a great compact size. Fits well in the pocket. The vibrator sucks. I never feel it vibrate. Oh and a couple times the clock was off by a couple hours and my alarm didn't go off. It's an adventure, this phone. You never know what's going to happen. It's like oh hey let me call Janice and you press the numbers and hit dial and you don't know if it's going to call Janice right away, 2 minutes from now, or never! hahahaha!!!! I will say it's better than an iPhone in that if someone stole my friend's iPhone and smashed it with a hammer he would be heart broken that he lost all that money, whereas if a hooligan snatched my Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G from me and smashed it with a hammer I would just laugh and then by like 3 more of these for the price of an iPhone.

"7524","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","This smartphone worked fine at first - charged fast and the 4G network quality was acceptable. I noticed that the phone reached its discharge battery level relatively quickly, up to 2 days which decreased steadily to 8hrs. This is not acceptable for my needs. The Android OS that came with the phone was up to my expectations with some features hard to use and hard to find but nevertheless helpful (for myself for some I believe). The response or speed was also fine (at 1GHz system clock for the application processor). Display was also fine (resolution/colors). Touch was sluggish. The worst thing was that the phone went simply DEAD after one week of light use!!! I'd expect more that one week, and this experience was simply not worth it. Sorry folks but this is a part of my story. I could not charge the phone, could not power it up could do nothing against it. Looks like the dynamic memory (RAM) lost its configuration and the system could not recover from this fault ever again - the last message from this phone: ""ramdump while uploading"".

"7538","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","3","This is one of the best budget smart phones I could find for T-mobile currently. I have a 2 year contract with T-mobile and it is not prepaid. I had bought a used HTC G2, but it bricked after 1 year of use. Since I purchased the HTC G2 used and it wasn't covered with warranty I was left to find a smart phone to use. When I went to a T-mobile store, buying a smart phone from the kiosk would cost 350 and up. The current flagship smartphone for T-Mobile is the HTC One S and has a list price of 599. Even with the offer to split the payment over several months, the idea of spending that much for a smart phone that would be obsolete in a few years bothered me. At almost half the price of what was being offered at T-mobile's kiosk, I found this phone.I quickly discovered there are many bargain android smart phones that are unlocked (can be used on multiple carriers). If you are in the market to purchase a phone and already have a plan, be sure to check that the bandwidth frequencies are compatible. Some of the 3g and 4g phones will work fine with AT&T and not with T-Mobile (only EDGE). I found while searching the budget android phones, screen size varies greatly. Some of the cheaper phones around 100 seemed to have a smaller screen. Given it is the primary input, I knew that typing text messages and emails on a tiny screen would be irritating unless it had a physical keyboard or large enough screen.The Samsung Exhibit II is now a little dated, but comes with Gingerbread and a bunch of unnecessary apps that cannot be uninstalled unless you root the phone. Rooting the phone voids the warranty and is the only reason why I have not done so already. The response to input on the phone is fairly snappy and runs smoothly even though the RAM is a little small. The screen quality is surprisingly good and sharp. Call quality is decent. I was even able to make a video call with the phone and had no issue with it. The battery life with this phone has been typical of android phones that I have used, lasting about a day with moderate use before needing to be recharged. T-mobile's 4g network is very fast where I live, but is throttled after a certain amount of data has been used. At this price range, I think it is an excellent value.The reason I have given this product an only average rating is that text messaging would not work for a week. I went through all the typical troubleshooting methods and reset to factory default twice, contacted Samsung and T-mobile customer support to get text messages to send. Samsung was very unhelpful and stated that issues with text messaging are an issue with the phone service provider. T-mobile initially stated that it was Samsung's fault for not updating the drivers. When going through the T-mobile's forums, it became clear that I am not the only one with this issue. For a while the only way to send text messages was to disable the 4g and switch to EDGE. This bothered me a lot as it became very annoying to switch every time I wanted to send a text message. I was originally going to return this phone, but decided to call T-mobile one more time. The tech at T-mobile was able to fix the issue and stated that there was an error on their end and I am now able to send text messages. I've now had this phone for over a month and have not had any other issues.On a related note, the customer service at Amazon was stellar. I had called them stating my frustration with the product and how it was not operating as advertised. The CSR was very friendly and answered all my questions regarding Amazon's return policy. I am continually impressed by the competitive prices and customer service from Amazon.","990","Samsung","8"
"7539","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","When I tried to activate the phone online, the phone serial # (IMEI) was not recognized. I called customer service and an hour later the phone was activated. However, since I wanted to port my number from Virgin, I had to wait an additional 32 hours before that occurred. I realize that was probably due to Virgin, not T-Mobile, but still a hassle. In the meantime they gave me a temporary number to use.Now on to the phone itself. Tried to set up the WiFi calling to no avail even though I had an excellent signal from my router. The phone hooked up to my WiFi instantly with no issues, but the WiFi calling feature would not work. Tried to make calls on the network, and that didn't work either. Finally called support and after almost 2 hours of jumping through hoops, the rep tells me that the phone is probably defective. For T-mobile to make an exchange, it could take up to 2 weeks, so the rep suggested that I contact Amazon for a replacement, which I am now waiting for.I don't have a good feeling about this and I fully expect the replacement phone not to work either. I'm guessing that all of the Amazon stock on these phones probably were built at the same time. I will update my review after getting the replacement.","990","Samsung","8"

This suits me perfectly since I plan to use WiFi exclusively.About unlocking the handset, the CSR said that since I bough the phone from Amazon, it is Amazon who would provide me with a unlock code. I chatted with an Amazon CSR as well and they forwarded my query to their wireless team who will respond in a day or two.Anyone else have the same experience?Edit: Amazon's ""Wireless"" CSR came back with a canned reply that said - ""Sorry to hear you are having problems with your purchase.

"7542","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I am a loyal t-mobile customer. I was one year into my unbelievably inexpensive renewed contract when my phone died. Let me go back and say that the reason my monthly contract is so cheap is because I opted to pay full price for phones to roll the savings into my bill. Anyway, instead of looking to buy a cheap used replacement phone, I looked at prepaid options. Amazon had the cheapest deals. I ordered the Samsung Exhibit II. When it arrived, I stuck my sim card in (instead of the prepaid sim), turned it on and started using it immediately. I was blown away by all the features. Wi-Fi calling is the best. I had mediocre signal strength with my previous phone, but when using my home internet I never drop calls. Using the Wi-Fi at home also saves on data, even though I have unlimited data. My only complaint is the amount of bloatware that came installed on the phone. It takes up a substantial amount of space. What I did was purchase a 32gb micro sd card and saved all of my downloads to the card. I also purchased a tpu gel skin case for the phone through Amazon. It offers excellent protection without bulk. Another feature I enjoy is the front facing camera. I skype with family using the camera and my home internet for free! Overall, this is a fantastic phone. I've owned it for a month and it has worked flawlessly.","990","Samsung","8"

Power/volume buttons are in a terrible place. When I hold the phone to press the power button, I also press the volume buttons! This is a terrible design.2. Phone is very slippery, especially if you are holding it awkwardly due to #1 above. You will need a case to protect from falls and drops.3. The virtual keyboard is not good if you have even normal size fingers. I spend a lot of time backspacing to correct the wrong letters as I type.4. Sometimes phone loses settings after powering off and powering on again (e.g., vibrate).5. Bluetooth/SYNC issue where the phone disconnects randomly from SYNC in the car without any warning. This is terrible as I miss calls while driving. Can't use cell and drive so this is key!!!6. Poor poor poor battery life. I don't really surf a lot (except for the ocassional Pandora session) and rarely use the phone while in the office, so why is the battery being drained so low every day?? Probably due in part to the...7....crap software that is loaded and running on this phone. Just don't have the patience to try and figure out how to remove the useless junk. I have seen mulitple posts on how to do this so it's worth looking for, if interested.Overall, it is not a bad phone, but it is frustrating to have to deal with all the minor issues.

In addition the phone is wifi enabled which allows it to use a wifi connection to extend its network. I live in a very thick apartment complex and couldn't get service with my old verizon phone, but this one gets perfect signal.

You have to wait a minute (literally) and then, if you're lucky, it will work. I have antivirus installed and know that the phone is clean. It's great with using apps and overall I like the phone. It's just a few quirks that irritate me and prevent me from giving it a better review. It's still not bad for the money.

After about two weeks of going back and forth, I gave up, it wasn't worth it the energy being spent. In addition, the screen just goes black/blank for several seconds before getting to its destination. Battery life is awful (even with no apps running). Major delays moving from task to task. Adjusted settings so screen would stay on during calls, but it still goes blank. Phone get very hot on just a single, 20-minute call. Volume on calls not good at all.

"7573","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I had a problem with this phone and had to visit a T-mobile center only to find out that because I ordered it on line I had to send it to manufacturer at my own expense, for repairs and put down a deposit to get a loaner flip phone not one comparable to my phone. Still waiting to here when my phone will be returned to me they said 7 to 14 days. The good thing is it was still under warranty since I only bought it in April 2013. I never dropped it or got it wet so I don't understand why it broke so soon. Stay tuned for updates on the quality of the repair and how long it took me to get it back.","990","Samsung","8"
"7574","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","So far it has been working great I bought it just a while ago. Has two problems. First problem is that when I want to reply to a message, where it says ""Tap here to enter message"" I have to click it several times before the keyboard pops up so I can write. Second, the battery runs out pretty quickly, I do have my Wi-Fi on all the time and use whatsup app but that's it. I have to recharge the battery every night. I do not know if that is normal for phones to do that since this is my first smartphone. I may buy one of those rechargeable batteries that are sold on Amazon to replace this one. Anyway overall, the phone is pretty nice and not bad for the price.","990","Samsung","8"

"7576","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I bought 3 of these and they are great phones. I used one prepaid T-Mobile card on each one as they were purchased, then I unlocked it and signed up with PureTalkUSA. Unlocking was completely painless (which is the main reason I bought a 3rd one). Now I have unlimited talk and text plus a second account for a total outgo of about $40 a month. I really like the Android operating system and the phone is tough and attractive. It's a bit small if you don't have good eyesight and at times my big hands miss the icon I'm aiming at.All I have installed is the Amazon Store app and Amazon mp3 player, Opera Mobile browser, NQ Mobile security and an improved file manager. I installed SanDisk 32GB SD cards in both phones; just pop them in and boot.The only real downside is the bloatware. Sometimes I fill the memory and most of it is bloatware. Clicking the NQ Optimizer button clears enough memory to continue using the phone, but shutting down the bloatware does no good; these useless apps just start back up. If this problem was just a little less severe I would just live with it, but it looks like I will have to root all three of these phones. The bloatware just doesn't leave enough memory for the average users needed apps.Update: I have now unlocked and rooted this phone; both operations are simplistic if approached correctly. Unlocking is a snap and rooting only has one pitfall. Don't try to root with the one click applications; I tried that way and after several attempts overseen by the software authors (and installing a lot of java ME libraries on my laptop) we all gave up. The easy way can be found documented on theunlockr dot com site. The biggest gotcha is that clockwork mod must be installed *first* (cwm.6012.t679.zip). If you do that and then install root (root-stock.zip) you are rooted. NOTE: reboot as soon as you are rooted and then run a root checking program (there is a good one available here on Amazon (Root Analyzer). For about $7 you can then purchase Root Explorer and upgrade Superuser to Superuser Elite and download Root App Delete on Google Play. Root App Delete is a great application for uninstalling bloatware; the apps are listed as Unknowns (user installed or bundled popular apps) which can be safely uninstalled; operating system apps and kernel modules are listed as such (leave them alone, NOTOUCH etc.). I also run RAM Control Extreme; note that this app needs to be configured not to kill things while you are using them, but when configured properly it will clean things up in the background without even bothering you (I configured it to run every 30 min.). I suppose these modifications carry some risk, but nothing bad has happened to me and I see lots of similar testimonials out there.With about 2 hours work I was rooted and another hour of uninstalling and my memory stays about 49% used if controlled by a good Android Ram Manager (was as much as 90+ percent used before and most of it bloatware). The phone boots faster and runs faster and the changes are transparent. I lost no functionality. Better yet I can now use apps which require root access.With a little work and a little additional expense I now have a phone that cost about $200 that is (at least) equal to the $600 ""Unlocked International version""). With a pocketful of sims I can use this phone anywhere in the world. This phone is a great buy compared to the price of competitors. Recommended.Update: I have flashed my personal T679 with Cyanogenmod and like this phone even better. I overclocked it to 1024 MHz (stock is a little under 300) and after about a week I hit the right combination of hot temperature and working the phone to cause it to hang once. I dropped it back to 806 MHz and after 3 weeks still no problems and I work this phone as hard as some people work their tablets. The obvious tradeoff is that the battery drains faster with it overclocked. For me that isn't a problem; I have chargers everywhere (desk, pickup, bed stand, etc.) and I work it most of the time plugged in. I am a little rough on my phones no doubt in the same sense a racer is rough on his wheels but that's what I bought it for.Cyanogenmod also has much better memory control built in. It is just about perfect for me now; liking it better all the time. Glad I bought these phones. Recommended.","990","Samsung","8"

"7589","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","I am using it with T-mobile monthly4G $30 for 100 min and unlimited (5GB) data. My wife has Virgin mobile LG Optimus V with $35 or $25 (price increased last year, but previous subscribers still pay $25) / month no contract for 300 min and unlimited (2GB) 3G data.Pros.1) Hardware faster and better compared with LG Optimus V2) 4G is faster than 3GCons.1) It is T-mobile! Monthly4G $30 for 100 min and unlimited (5GB) data plan is offered at WalMart or online only, T-Mobile web-site is glitchy. I could not complete activation online, by phone T-Mobile will try to rip you off $50 a month. T-mobile promised to change the plan in 10 min, but I had to call them several times.2) It is T-mobile! Samsung Exhibit II 4g specs has FM radio hardware built-in, but FM radio is removed from t-mobile version by t-mobile request in order to suck your 4G data limit.3) It is T-mobile! It has preinstalled Carrier IQ, which is keystroke logging and location tracking software, which can intercept text messages. Even information that should be transferred only within encrypted sessions is captured in plain text by Carrier IQ. Worse Carrier IQ is integrated with task manager and cannot be easily uninstalled (I have not found uninstallation way yet).4) It is T-mobile! Besides Carrier IQ phone has a lot of preinstalled crapware. LG Optimus V from Virgin Mobile is practically clean compared with Samsung Exhibit II 4G.5) It is T-mobile! Phone has calling over IP using your wi-fi network, but T-mobile will rip off your monthly minutes or charge you 10 cents a minute over 100 minutes for using call over your wi-fi. To avoid it you need to use Skype or Google talk (GrooVe IP) over wi-fi or 4G. 5GB limit is sufficient, but you need to spend your time again to configure GrooVe IP.Bottom line.Phone is good, but avoid T-mobile and Samsung (Samsung preinstalled Carrier IQ on many phones), I suggest to chose Virgin Mobile and LG unless you really need 4G speed and do not care about your privacy. They have LG Optimus V really cheap. Alternatively you can invest your time and install custom firmware for this phone, but this is a new model, and there is not so much choice available yet (unlike Galaxy S or LG Optimus V). There is no cyanogenMod for this phone yet. Probably better to wait a half year before dealing with this phone unless you are going to contribute into custom mode developing yourself (see discussing below).Update:Installed Titanium backup (backup system), RebelROM (custom firmware), GrooVe IP (free calling using google voice works fine over wi-fi and 4g), juice defender (save your precious bodily fluids, battery power). Never automatic update phones with custom ROM, no factory restore... Everything clean and working, but too much work required. Cleaning other Android phones, including Samsung Galaxy S and LG Optimus, is much simpler and faster. One star for wasting my time, five star for the phone potential with future better custom ROM (waiting for cyanogen mode).","990","Samsung","8"
"7590","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","The Samsung Exhibit II 4G is a great phone. The Amazon price for this phone was 100.00 cheaper than the T-mobile price. I researched this phone and this phone has met my expectations and more. I previously had a Blackberry 9700.The TeleNav GPS app that had a monthly fee is a free app on this phone. Also, includes the Google navigation and maps. So 2 Navigation apps for free.The Voice Search works as well as the Iphone voice search app. The phone is easy to use and set-up. If you dont turn off the apps running in the background the battery will die in 5hrs. So, turn off the background apps, backout of the apps no longer in use. My battery last at least 12 hrs-14hrs.The only negative is , the screen washes out in the bright sun. For the money, and 30-50 dollars a month( depending on the plan us choose) you can't get a better phone. It is a great phone. i just set up Kies air which I can view on my PC everything on my phone, pictures, messages, videos etc. Supports Adobe Flash player which my Blackberry 9700 did not. I could on.

I had a couple quick questions right now that you guys could probably answer. I want to use the prepaid $30 plan that walmart offers but you can't get through the t-mobile store...so buying this phone on amazon...do I still need to buy a sim card activation kit or will it come with a new sim card I can use to get the $30 plan? Some people have been saying that you need to buy the phone from walmart to take advantage of the plan - but others say you need to buy an activation kit. I was wondering if ordering a new one on amazon will be sufficient without the kit. Also, on a 100 minute plan, I am worried I may go over, but I was thinking - Skype doesn't use minutes, I can just use the data for that, correct? Sorry if these questions have already been answered - I just want to buy the activation kit online now so I can be ready for tomorrow if I need to buy it.

"7592","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","This is my first smart phone. It has a lot of functions and I haven't accessed them all yet. Three things I want to mention: first, as many know and are unhappy about, the daily battery life is not very long. I followed others advice and turned off most of the loaded applications and selected the battery saving selections found under Settings. Still, you'll be recharging the phone every day, since I don't even use it every day or have it on all day at a time.Second, as opposed to my Samsung not-smart phone which turned on right away, the Exhibit you have to press the power button 3-4 seconds before it lights up, awkward and annoying. Then it is a almost 30 seconds before it is booted up.Thirdly,and Most Important, right from the beginning every few days or so when I turned on the phone I would get a black field on the screen with the white-lettered phrase ""RAM dump mode Cause: Forced download"", at which point I could do nothing with the phone, not even turn it off. I would have to open it up and pull the battery, like a forced powerdown on a computer. After reinserting I could boot up again. No one seemed to know what this was about, so I called Samsung. The customer rep talked me into the settings selections to find some codes. One of them, the ""kernel version"" she identified as not the code for the version with which Samsung programs the phone. The phone had arrived in a brand-new T-Mobile Samsung box and packaging, but somehow it seems the phone had been unofficially ""modified"". The customer rep didn't know how this would have occurred. Samsung e-mailed me a UPS prepaid return label and had me send it back to their service center in Texas for ""re-flashing"". Samsung sent me an e-mail on January 27 notifying that they had received the phone and then sent another one on February 2 notifying that they had shipped it back to me. As I am writing this and wondering when the phone will be delivered and thinking perhaps I should hold off on this review until I've tried the phone again,I thought to check the tracking code Samsung sent me. I just cheked the UPS tracking and it said the delivery was today, 2 hours ago, ""left at front door"". I went to check and there it was! I have booted it up. So far so good... we'll see if the gremlin is actually gone. I can say that Samsung customer service is excellent.","990","Samsung","8"

"7595","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","Ordered this phone for my 17 year old son. He was previously on a Verizon plan; basic phone with 450 min (he would use between 1 to 5 min per month, what a waste - it was all texting) & unlimited text. I was paying 62.00 per month with my 22% discount from work for 2 years. Once I was off contract I cancelled Verizon and the search was on. He wanted a smart phone, but I did not want to be tied to a 2 year contract paying over 100.00 a month.

"7596","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","I have been a Tmobile prepaid customer for about six years now. I use fifty to a hundred dollars worth of time a year. Service was good until I put a tin roof on my house and it blocked the signal. I knew Tmobile let you access their network through a home wireless so I went looking for a new GSM phone with WiFi capabilities. The ones I liked were way expensive without a contract but I got serious when my old RAZR started giving me trouble around Christmas.I found this one on Amazon and started looking at the specs and reading the reviews. I needed a phone with WiFi for the house. I wanted one that would play my music. I wanted one that I could use my existing prepaid simm without buying a data plan. Not as simple as it sounds but this phone performs the functions quite well. In addition I installed SKYPE and it works perfectly in the house. I use a SKYPE out subscription for my long distance calls (I am on prepaid remember and even though the phone connects through my WiFi it uses minutes) and all the long distance calls for a year are $30.The battery could last longer but it is acceptable if I charge it every night. As others have stated the bloatware is horrific and I will fix this as soon as I root the phone in the next few days. This should also help with the battery life.The sad thing is I went to my local world wide everything for everybody department store looking for accessories. A silicone skin, some screen protectors and so on. Not a thing and they sell this phone. They did have two isles of iphone accessories but then they don't sell iphones at that particular store.I am just getting started. I will check back if any thing really good or surprising happens. OH and anything bad.ONE MONTH AFTER PURCHASEI rooted the phone and cleaned up the bloatware. Put in a 16Mb Micro SD and lots of music. I am on a road trip and use the SKYPE for calls anywhere I stop with WiFi. Loaded some useful free apps and a few paid ones. For the most part I mostly use it to make and receive calls but the music is nice when no acceptable radio stations are in my area.","990","Samsung","8"

Especially when you are just arrived in a new country and you don't know anything about the networks etc. After a good deal of reading, I settled on this Samsung Exhibit II on T-mobile. The phone specs looked very respectable for the price point. I wanted PAYG so I wasn't tied into a contract that would last longer then my stay in the US.When the phone arrived, it was very easy to set up. The instructions are very clear. I had it registered and activated on the network even before the battery finished charging. Within a day I had received an over the air update of the Android operating system to Gingerbread. It would be nice to get Ice Cream Sandwich or Jellybean on this handset, but for the price point that is probably wishful thinking.Still it is a good phone. 4G speeds are very good. T-mobile did stick a lot of bloatware on it, that can only be removed by rooting which is a shame, but an easy process if you want to do it.","990","Samsung","8"

If you don't restart it at LEAST once a day, the phone will go extremely slow, apps will freeze, and things simply will not work. It is EXTREMELY frustrating, and that is probably the only reason i'm writing this review. I would not buy this phone again, and the first chance i get, I will be smashing it to pieces. I know it is a low end phone, but when you have less than 10 downloaded apps and you can't access your photo gallery because there isn't enough space on your phone, it get very frustrating.

"7607","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","Postscript 12/16/2013: I've now dedicated this handset to car use - both in terms of OBDII monitoring and motion video recording. Additionally, when not in monitoring use, for vehicle location, something Android/Google lets you do. Completely brilliant, it's sat in the frozen SUV, well shielded, without freezing or dying, reporting its location back to Google. This is, admittedly, a specialized non-phone application, but considering the capabilities and the price it is very well suited for that. Love it. I mean, you don't want to take a $500 phone and use it for tinkering, if you're not independently wealthy, but this, I can manage, the ancillary mobile charge is only $10/month.Postscript 9/26/2013: This device/version of Android works brilliantly with the Paypal Here device and application - I understand not all Galaxy's do. The only caveat is that you need to set up the Paypal app with a mobile #/PIN login - a regular login crashes the app. The new version of the Android Device Manager, accessible at the Google site, which can locate, lock or wipe the phone remotely, works with this handset too. GPS works fine, so does Bluetooth, WiFi calling (UMA) works, and I am impressed with the battery life - my Blackberry Torch 9810 doesn't last a full day on 4G, the Exhibit 4G does. All in al, the T679 provides a very stable, manageable, and capable little handset, for relatively little money.Original review 9/21/2013: What with 672 reviews of this unit, you probably don't really need mine, so let me just add why I purchased it, and what I found. I- wanted to get a sufficiently advanced Android device so I could try Paypal's ""Here"" credit card device;- wanted to learn a bit of Android, having been a Blackberry / Nokia aficionado until now; and- wanted a device I could use with one of my existing postpaid T-Mobile lines.It does all that, admirably. I'll add a postscript as soon as I've had a chance to test the Paypal device, but for now, I was able to pop in one of my SIM cards, and have the thing come up on TMO's 4G (HSPA+) and use its UMA (WiFi Calling). IOW, all good, there aren't any restrictions on the device as far as I can see, it'll use 4G data too, although I have that turned off on this line for now.The Android thing was just to satisfy my curiousity, what can I tell you, it works, I can't quite fathom all of the excitement, other than that you get a gazillion apps, which for those with the time to play must be a Godsend. I like the support I get from Google, including Google Maps with offline capability, and Google Voice, something I've been using for a long time. Am I happy telling Google where I go, what I do, who I do it with, and when? No, so this handset will never be my primary handset, but if that doesn't bother you, this is a very cheap - although as I write this it's gone up a bit from what I paid - powerful, and very convenient, pretty little handset. I do realize it is fashionable to carry a flat screen TV in your shirt pocket these days, but for those not bothered, and for those who already have a tablet and a laptop, this is a nice device. I especially like the lack of buttons on the surround - on my Blackberry and my Nokia, I am forever pushing things I shouldn't. Importantly, this is a brand spanking new, T-Mobile branded, device, with the factory seals intact, and updated to the latest (2.3.6 T679UVLK2) Android version available for it, at a very decent price - mine came from shopcelldeals, can't vouch for other vendors. TMO will even unlock it for you, if you're an existing customer and you meet the requirements, and they provide the warranty and support for it.Enjoy.","990","Samsung","8"
"7608","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","While the phone does take pretty decent pictures, and even has a decent amount of memory meant to deal with applications, it falls short where it matters. This is the first phone I've ever had that just shuts down by itself for no apparent reason. As it can do this twenty times a day, and without any indication of it having done so as long as it's in my pocket, things can be very frustrating. I bought this one quickly as a replacement for an LG that decided to go for a swim. While the price for an immediate replacement was right with the Exhibit, I wish I would have waited. The issue with it shutting down is not isolated to myself either. Just do a Google search and you will see that this is a very common problem. Stay away from this one if you value your peace (i.e. lack of frustration). Also, while the memory is technically there to handle applications, it doesn't seem to actually work. It is very slow at times. Very slow.","990","Samsung","8"

"7610","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","2","It was surprise to discover that it is locked phone NOT UNLOCKED phone as stated when I bought it. I feel that seller has cheated by stating it UNLOCK phone. Now 30 days is over, I would not be able to return back.I discover that it is Locked phone on visiting International country, out of USA, and wanted to use local SIM card cell phone provider. On inserting it asked UNLOCK key to enter. I entered random number to unlock the phone, it was not accepted and there is only 10 attempt to enter UNLOCK key.I called T mobile customer care and I felt that call was outsourced to Philippines.Their answer why they cannot help:Thank you for taking the time to contact T-Mobile. We have received your SIM Unlock Request. Unfortunately, we are unable to process your request at this time. The account must meet the following criteria:1. Subscriber has been active for 40 days since the device was first used on the line2. Must have $50.01 or more in accumulative refills since activation3. Must have device usage within the last 7 days by the mobile number requesting the unlock codePlease submit a new SIM Unlock Request once the subscriber has met the Eligibility criteria.I felt that customer care based in Philippines appears to be interested in finding the reason why they cannot help. It appears that they just read the script. They are good with FAQ.I think when it is pre paid phone and customer has paid full price of phone, it is right of customer to have unlock phone. If it is locked phone, customer care should be able to assist in unlocking the phone right away.I gave 2 star rating because it is LOCKED phone, not UNLOCK phone as stated when I bought it.","990","Samsung","8"
"7611","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","3","I've had this phone over a year now & its been okay. I will say that if you don't have patience, don't buy this phone. It will test your patience on numerous occasions. For one, the memory is terrible. After about eight months into the phone, I have no memory what so ever to listen to music & take photos/look through photos. It glitches a lot. With incoming phone calls the screen will be black for a few seconds THEN will show the call screen, whereas on better smart phones the call will automatically show up. Loading applications takes a little longer than desired. I've tried applications in which that would help speed up the phone, but there's only so much you can do. Sometimes, if the phone is overwhelmed by so much, it just reboots itself. The battery, over time, will go on you, especially if you use a lot of applications. I would suggest to constantly have a charger handy. I mean, for a person that needs a phone with basic smart phone capabilities for cheap, this is okay. However, I have learned my lesson not to be cheap with my cell phones. I'll be sure to save up & look at higher end models for now on. Good luck with this phone.","990","Samsung","8"

Also, within those 6 days, the phone shut down and restarted on it's own while I was in the middle of applications. I should have done my research and checked out other reviews (who said the same thing) before I made my purchase.","990","Samsung","8"
"7615","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","This phone is slow, narcoleptic, and apparently haunted. It takes forever to open anything or even make a call. It's like it gets stuck and has to think about it each time you press a button. I assume the processor is just really cheap and bad. It also randomly shuts itself off at inopportune times, so I have to check on it every 30 min or so if I'm expecting a call to make sure it hasn't gone to sleep. It also just randomly starts programs, like when I click on ""messaging"" and it opens my camera. It is supposedly 4G but is way slower to load internet than my girlfriends iPhone with 3G.

It was s***, SLOW....Whats more than slow, slower than cold honey in winter,I've upgraded and updated but nothing could have prepared me for how S*** this phone was. At the time it cost me the same as if i got the S3 or an iphone 4 which was much faster and did the same s***. So why get this phone, because i was looking for internal memory, THEY LIED!!! It had none.There was no internal memory so doing anything on the fly was a no go. It was slow to open applications, it could hold a load of external memory but nothing could prepare me for how slow this phone was.It has some good points, the mic and cam are ok but still slow to start up, the dialler would never open right away when i needed to make a call, and texting forget it, most of the time I’d have to wait 5 minutes just to send a text.

"7626","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","I regret buying this phone. First of all, it's overpriced and really expensive for someone on a budget. Second of all, as other people have noted, it's filled with bloatware and freezes a lot. I constantly have to reboot it. If that weren't enough, the battery life is really short, and lasts less than four hours. I even had to replace the battery because it melted and blew-up in the phone, Long story short: don't buy this. There are other phones out there that are of a better quality and that provide more bang for your buck. Also, do your utmost not to have T-Mobile as a carrier. They are awful, and I once had to wait over three months for them to fix their online system so I could pay online, and this is after getting transferred from operator to operator in order to get someone to listen to my call. They suck, and I'm warning you ahead of time. Please go with someone else.","990","Samsung","8"
"7627","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","Lets be honest, the 1 star reviewers have to have something wrong with them to rate this phone one star.This phone and plan is amazing ($30 100 minutes). You get the phone and simply go on tmobile.com to activate it. No walmart or anything. It simple. I get 4g ALL The time, and its so fast.Honestly I cant think of any cons except for the battery life. I usually charge it overnight then I have to charge it in the evening. But all in all this phone is great.And did I mention i rooted it? Got rid of all the useless apps.

I have been a T-Mobile customer for years, and I have been very happy with their cost-effective service.","990","Samsung","8"

"7630","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","Previously, I had a Moto xt720. I paid close to $500. Up to now with upgraded firmware, it has numerous glitches. I sold it. I decided to find another android phone but not so expensive. Also, any type of iphone was out of my price range.This was a great buy for $200. I have been hunting for a long time for a cheap but usable Android phone (i.e at least 1 ghz). The only options before this for the Galaxy S and HTC HD2 (I only go with HTC and Samsung) which were over my head in price. To be honest, I really didnt care for a powerful phone as my ipod touch 4th gen does the job for apps quite fine.I got a Tmobile sim card but is no use as I live in the caribbean and just unlocked it anyway for $25Pros:-The screen is comparable to the iphone's retina display and it is 3.7"" which is a plus. Touch screen is quite responsive except for small buttons sometimes.-Battery life is more than a day. (moderate wifi and calls connected to 2g only)(no 3g available here)-Camera is quite fine for random pictures, barcode scanner etc and includes a handy LED flash.-Includes a power saving mode which can be enabled at set battery percentages.-As usual, all the quality features of Android 2.3. (Hope to upgrade to cyanogenmod 9 or official 4.0 in the future)Cons:-The power/sleep button is on the right side of the phone. This can take some getting used to.For $200, you just cant go wrong","990","Samsung","8"

"7635","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","I bought this phone after reading so many good reviews. Unfortunately the one I received did not live up to those good reviews. So here is how it went for me:1. The plastic packaging on the phone was partly cut open when I received it. Since the phone looked brand new, I didn't think it was a problem and just went ahead and used it (opened the cardboard box). I never cut into any plastic to open it. Nothing else in the package was opened or touched as far as I could tell.2. The phone is not able to code it's own number into the SIM. So when you go to the phone status and check your own number, it simple says ""Unknown"". After spending hours searching for a solution on my own, contacting t-mobile support through chat and phone as well as going to a t-mobile store, the issue was never resolved. Their ""solutions"" ranged from wait and see to ""it can't be done"" and often contradicted each other as well. This seems to be a common issue with many t-mobile phones and the solutions ""vary"", none of which worked for me. Anyone can search the t-mobile support forum and I suggest doing that before buying a phone.3. The phone froze a few times. Initially I could hold the power button down to get it to reboot, but later only removing the battery would solve the problem. That's just unacceptable. T-mobile knows of this problem as well: [..]They blame 3rd party apps and lack of phone maintenance (rebooting). Well, I never installed any apps and I rebooted the phone far more often than I would have liked (several times a day to try and solve the above problem). It is loaded with bloatware, far far more than my Gio and my guess would be that is the reason for freeze-ups.4. The battery seems to drain very quickly and not unless I put it into constant power saving mode could it last a whole day. The first day I had it, I had to charge it 3x to keep it going after charging it fully to start with. I never even used up the entire $3.34 that is given as a starter credit, so making a ton of calls is not what used up the battery.I have a Samsung Gio that has never frozen up and the battery lasts for a couple of days even before needed a recharge. I put the t-mobile SIM it in and it could not code the number into it either. It has in the past coded numbers into other SIMs so I know it is capable of it. When I told t-mobile support this, he they told me that the Gio is not capable to code SIMs. I told him it can and does other ones just fine. He just went silent. I think T-Mobile's SIM is either defective or their methodology for over the air updates has some issues.I've returned the Exhibit II and will not buy another one. While the T-mobile staff are friendly and willing to help (almost all), it was mostly just a waste of my time. Good luck to anyone taking a gamble on it.","990","Samsung","8"

I was walking down a busy sidewalk at the time and I pulled out my phone to answer it. Neither the screen nor the buttons would respond to anything I did, so for about 45 seconds I continued to walk with the phone ringing full volume in my hand like some fool. Got some priceless looks.

I was maxing out the storage capacity with apps and photos on the Exhibit 4G, even though I used an SD card, it started getting a little glitchy and needing me to frequently clear cache, etc. So, I gave the Exhibit to my 13 yr old daughter who appreciates the front facing camera and is satisfied with it for texting and social apps, watching video, etc., all on Wi-Fi, as she has no data plan. Then, it got stolen from her and because it offers a lot for the price, we replaced it with the same phone (purchased on Amazon). I sure am glad I didn't spend more for her phone because she has since dropped it and cracked the screen. Fortunately, the crack isn't that bad and the phone still works great.

Even when it worked properly I wasn't real impressed with it anyway. It's built and feels very cheap (cheesy) like something you would win in one of those crane machines.

"7659","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","I thought I'd take the plunge and join the android craze. I just want my Blackberry back. This phone sucks monkey balls.- The battery life sucks. I have shut down everything in the background that should be sucking it dry (GPS, Bluetooth, etc) and I'm still charging it at least twice a day. I work on an ambulance.... I NEED to have a phone that I know will be charged in order to give patient reports. I can take this phone off the charger before I leave for work and by lunch time it's almost dead.- I have VERY small hands... I buy little kids gloves.... and even *I* can't text on this thing for crap. I feel like I should send out decoder rings with every text message.- Talk about slow. Even after I rooted it, it's still insanely slow to respond. I end up in a loop every day because I hit a button then wait 60 seconds for it to respond, hit the button again only to have whatever it is pop up then go away again. Makes me want to bang my head against the wall.- My god the fingerprints. I spend all day wiping them off. One more reason I hate touch screens. With a passion.- Even rooted it's a train wreck. I thought getting rid of all the bloatware would make a difference, but it doesn't.- This thing looses signal ALL the time. I got full strength in my house with my Blackberry... I barely get 2 bars here.- T-Mobile isn't even selling this POS anymore.- It takes it HOURS to charge fully. Sometimes it isn't even charged over night.It does take decent pics and video. The back speaker is surprisingly loud.I'm not sure I could hate this phone more all in all. I have ordered a new battery to see if that solves some of my issues. I'm not holding my breath and I can't wait to get rid of it.","990","Samsung","8"
"7660","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","I initially was really pleased with this phone. Setup was a snap and the phone was fully functional.However, what I found was that it had stability issues. It would often freeze running an app or unexpectedly restart the OS. When it froze, I would have to pull the battery to recover. Usually I had the problem at least once every day or two; but sometime several times in a right in a row it would crash. I installed the ""Gas Buddy"" app after the first week and found that using that app would consistently crash the phone. Being my first android phone, I asked other android users about stability and found their phones ran for weeks or months w/o issues.I found a firmware update on t-mobile site that was supposed to address ""stability"" issues[...] and was able to load it (Android version 2.3.6 / Software T679UVLE1) manually using the Samsung Kies tool (OTA update was no longer available from t-mob); however, it did not resolve the problem. After two weeks; I returned this phone after seeing a lot of similar issues reported on the online forum. Too bad; I really liked the phone other than the stability problems.I replaced it with a Samsung Blaze 4G and although I have only had it for a day I have not been able to crash it; even with the same ""gas buddy"" app that always crashed the Exibit. The Blaze also has a dual core 1.5Ghz processor versus the single core 1.0Ghz processor of the Exhibit and twice the RAM of the Exhibit. I did not think the Exhibit was particularly slow, but the Blaze is much faster on everything and noticeably more responsive running a very similar build of android 2.3.6 compared to the Exhibit.","990","Samsung","8"
"7661","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","3","I love this phone! There's so many reasons why this is such a great phone, here's a few off the top of my head...1. Low price for an unlocked full featured phone (have to wait 60 days to unlock free)2. Large User base and developer/hacker base. Plenty of Samsung Exhibit II user forums to get most of your newbie questions answered3. Lots of inexpensive accessories/batteries/cases. I paid $13 for a bundle that included 2 batteries/charger/gel case/screen protector4. Lots of useful info by other owners/users if you read the reviews here5. Great multimedia Android phone. I just finished watching the latest Transformers movie on the phone with Netflix!6. Excellent T-Mobile 4G network7. Excellent, inexpensive prepaid plans. I pay only $30 per month using the Walmart 100 min/unlimited data/text plan8. Turn your phone into a wireless hotspot for only $15/month and run your laptop and up to 5 wifi devices using your phone as a wifi hotspot.9. Use your Gmail and Google Calendar and Google Maps10. Great GPS functions and mapping11. Facebook, Meetup.com, Metro.net etc. most of the websites that I frequent have apps available12. microSDHC slot to add up to 32gb of memory13. Camera, voice/audio recorder14. Free wifi calling using Google Voice and GrooveIP. Takes a little messing around but once you get it, you'll love it and not use up your 100 minutes. Buy the$5.00 full version of GrooveIP and don't bother with the free/crippled version.14. Plenty of hacks to root this phone and get rid of bloatwareI bought this phone from Amazon and use the Walmart/Tmobile $30 prepaid plan giving me unlimited data/texting and 100 minutes of voice calls. But with the FREE WiFi calling (see #14) I use less than 50 minutes a month as I'm always around a wifi network. If I manage to exceed the 100 minutes, I pay 10 cents a minute... big deal... Later this month, I'm gonna try using the phone as a wifi hotspot ($15/mo) and if it works well at home, I'll dump my cable service that I pay $136/month for cable internet and tv!Just re-upped with Netflix for $8/month for unlimited instant videos as they've added a lot of movies to their catalog and don't bother with the mail in DVD's anymore... Although I did just buy a Blu-Ray player... The Netflix movies play great... well, I was using my cable/wifi connection to watch a movie. I haven't tried watching a video on just the 4G connection yet.Oh, I live at the bottom of a canyon in the Hollywood Hills and most of the other service providers I would not get any reception but with T-Mobile I get a solid 3-4 bars!Cons:1. Battery life is not too long if you are a heavy web user. But buy a couple of spare batteries ($7ea) and no problemo...2. Phone is small and slippery standard, so get the gel case and that will fix the problem and protect the phone3. Seems I can't view my Amazon Prime free videos on the phone. But maybe it's possible and I just haven't figured it out yet...Yeah, I'm a huge fan... this is a great deal for the phone and low monthly cost for a prepaid/no contract unlocked phone.UPDATE 9-2013: I suppose I've downloaded too many apps. My web browsing and operation of the phone has slowed considerably. I am now planning to root my phone and remove all apps that are bloatware and not needed. Thus at this time, I'm down grading this review from 5 stars to 3 stars. This is a single core processor, so my next phone will most likely be a quad core or no less than a dual core processor. If after I root the phone and it enhances the performance back to acceptable levels, I'd bump the rating back up. zxcvb","990","Samsung","8"

"7669","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I had an iphone 3g for a few years. But I had tmobile and the 2g speeds were maddening. So I went to the android side and got this phone because I did not want to spend a lot, but wanted 4g speed. I got that.Physical size is same as the iphone. Screen is fine. Those that say it doesn't view well in the sun, make sure your brightness is turned up. Mine defaulted to the lowest setting and it took me a month to figure out that was the problem.Phone is light. Responsive. Call quality is good. 4g speeds are great, though sometimes I lose a signal, but I think that's not the phone as I live in a dead spot.Transition to Android was entertaining. Not the closed system of Apple, so there is some funkiness that I liken to the PC world, though not that crazy. Rooted the phone to get rid of a lot of bloatware, and I highly recommend you do that.Changed the theme to look like an iphone as I mentally have committed certain icons to certain functions.Battery life is fairly good. I can usually go a couple of days without charging and I use my phone a fair amount.When I was in the tmobile store, I drooled over the Galaxy S2. But in the end, I have an ipad, so why do I need a galaxy. This phone was cheap and highly functional.My only minor complaint is the lack of a better ""on"" button, as the power button on the side of the unit is a little hard to depress at times to wake up the phone. But I can live with that.All in all, I think this is a great 4g android phone for less than $200. Hard to go wrong.Ironically, I tried to buy this at the local tmobile store in my town to support local business. But because of the challenges the carriers have with previous contracts and lots of small print rules governing the prices of phones, the best they could do was $350. Hello amazon.","990","Samsung","8"
"7670","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I've owned this phone for more than one month and in general I'm quite satisfied by its performance.Pros:1. Price. For $200 you get the experience similar with those flagships 1-year ago (Samsung GS I with a smaller screen), and more importantly, with the 2.3.5 OS.2. Rootable. It could be very easily rooted by using the same protocol for the 1st gen. Ppl really shouldn't complain about bloatware anymore but did a little research on this.3. $30 unlimited data plan. If you get covered by the T-Mobile 4G then it's a steal to get 5Gb 4G speed+free text and some free minutes (100). Time to forget about those basic smartphone plans cost $70 pre-tax elsewhere.Cons:1. CPU. Single core 1G is simply not enough to run the OS smoothly when 4-6 apps are running in the background. I have three email apps (Gmail, regular email app and Hotmail) and a newsfeed actively synchronizing in the background and the phone usually takes 0.5s to turn on the screen after pressing the power button and another 2-3s to make screens switch smoothly. One tweak is turning off the screen animation to get better response. Soft video decoding is also poor and frame-skipping happens quite often even when the bitrate is less than 500kbps.2. Battery. With 4G data and background synchronizing only (Wifi, BT, GPS all off), the battery can last about 30 hours in idle. In daily use you may have to charge it every night.Overall:Based on its performance/price, it definitely should be considered as a top prepaid phone with a perfectly matched plan.","990","Samsung","8"
"7671","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","I have had the phone for about a month now. I must say that going from a ""dumber"" phone to this has been a life changing experience and I will never go back to a non-smart phone. The phone itself is really quite nice, it is the perfect size (not to big, not to small) but like many have commented, very slippery! Getting a case for it is a must. As noted, it does come with some bloatware that is preinstalled and the only way to get rid of some of the applications (like media social, etc) is to root the phone (this gives you administrative rights - for the brave just google ""rooting samsung exhibit II"" and you will be able to find the means to do so).Since many reviewers have described the positive aspects of the phone, I wanted to point out that not all is rosy with T-mobile's pre-paid 100min, free text, free web plan. I was dismayed to find out that I was not able to use Google Voice as the default voicemail for the phone, nor was I able to use T-mobile's own preinstalled visual voicemail --- I can see the business logic behind these moves (T-mobile does not want pre-paid customers to have easy ways to get around using the limited 100 minutes while checking voicemail (google voice and visual voicemail use data instead of minutes)....still, I feel that T-mobile has mislead customers (they have nothing on their website that states that going pre-paid ""limits"" some of the features vs. what subscribing clients have access to).Still, it's not a bad deal overall - just annoying that they treat pre-paid customers like 2nd rate clients.","990","Samsung","8"

"7675","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","This is my first smart phone and I was lured in by the reasonable price and T-Mobile's new $30 unlimited text, unlimited data, 100 minutes plan. I simply could not justify the expense of phone and data before. I think this phone is great value for $200. It has almost every feature I want. The only thing I would have really liked would be a 5mp camera like on the Galaxy S. I handled a Galaxy S and was considering buying a refurbished one of those for $150 more before deciding on the Exhibit II. I don't regret saving the money. Unless you've had a higher quality phone before, or you're comparing this side-by-side with something higher end, you won't feel limited or cheated by this phone. It's got a very crisp vibrant display, runs quick and smooth, and even with the 3.2mp camera I've taken some decent photos. Sure beats my previous phone anyway. Battery easily lasts me from 6am to late in the night. I haven't had it actually die on me yet. I don't know how my usage might compare to others, but I use Facebook and email frequently throughout the day, have tried out the GPS navigation a couple of times, used Google Music, surfed a bit of news, and played Words With Friends. The display is the biggest battery drain I think, so I keep that down pretty low all the time. I don't do much talking, hence getting the plan with only 100 minutes, so I can't say how much battery is affected by talk time.Only a couple of gripes... As others have mentioned, the beep when the battery is charged is annoying. I charge my phone by my bed at night and I still want to be able to receive emergency calls and texts so I'm not going to put it on silent in order to avoid that beep. But it does wake me up. Still, I can live with it.Sometimes texts fail to send and I've seen other people in forums with this problem too. Also the texting app is glitchy and doesn't always respond to your taps in the text area to bring up the keyboard.Yes, the back cover is as slippery as everyone else says. I bought the gel skin case for the Galaxy W (same phone as the Exhibit II, just rebranded outside the US) and I'm so glad I did. I would certainly have dropped the phone repeatedly by now if I didn't have the skin.Overall, I highly recommend this phone. Excellent price for $200, especially if you're been holding out for a while for the price of smart phones and data plans to drop.","990","Samsung","8"
"7676","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","Solid performance on a great network. Had to call to port my old number. The process was done the next morning before noon. As for the phone it just works. It handles the newest apps and games without any issue. Some may wish for a ""vanilla"" android experience but after using a phone like that i find Samsungs Touchwiz interface a nice improvement. I could re hash all the good stuff about this phone but for that you can read the other reviews. As for issues, which i may be alone on. I find the internal memory partitioning to be confusing at best. Theres a main system partition of 1 gig then a second 2 gig partion called usb memory. Thats all well and good but most apps that dont have custom save settings dont have a selection for it. I use an external memory card but this space seems a little odd. It seems like they wanted to give you some protected memory for music i guess its kind of odd. please comment if you know whats up with it. On to other things.The phone is as slippery as everyone says and with curved edges i never take it out without a death grip on it. Its more than just slick plastic. that textured back is like wrapping a hockey puck in nylon, and the phone is very light.The antennas seem to be in the base of the phone. i can sit in my living room and hold the top of the phone and get 4 bars on a 4g tower. Then hold around the bottome it will drop to the point that it switches to edge. Outside this is not an issue so no worries, its just a little odd.And last up the network.Tmobile is pretty solid where i live which is funny because they dont even have phone numbers around here.

The screen is clear and bright even during mid day, email and messages work nicely with push notifications from gmail app. The camera is ok, both front and back cameras work fluidly during skype chats and music is clear with 5.1 surround sound on headphones. The touch screen is very receptive although at times you feel your don't have the smooth surface to use swype effectively, trick is not to actually clean your screen so often. Browsing is good with Wifi and GPS working great and connect at N speeds if your router supports.One more thing about GPS, you DON'T need to have a data plan for GPS to work. You can pre catch using google maps a certain area of 10 miles radius and use GPS to navigate without data plan, it works. Also you can use all those health and fitness apps (although I recommend my tracks by google) to record the track you run/jog/cycle and then come back home to overlay the map and share. Once again GPS does NOT require data plan.Yes as everyone else mentioned, the available ram is only 356 MB and not the entire 512 MB. If you don't root the phone, there are bunch of apps from T-mobile which will eat up all the ram and usually hovers at around 315 MB, once rooted you really feel the speed of the phone, and ram hovers at 250 MB, ofcourse depending upon the programs you run.","990","Samsung","8"

My wife's Samsung Transform Ultra from Boost mobile with just 800Mhz processor does not do it for similar functions. But the issue is fixed after a reboot.

Secondly for the nearly two years I owned this piece of junk, it turned out to be one of the worst choices I could have made for a phone. It was slow, froze up all the time and crashed like cars on a highway in a snowstorm. No amount of custom ROMs could save it. Now I wouldn't even give this away knowing the grief it would cause someone else.Soon it will be 2016 and there are plenty of great deals on GOOD phones now unlike in 2012.

"7692","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","This is my first ""smart"" phone if that is the correct term for this phone. For the past almost five years I have been using the same old Nokia - which served me well. I wanted another Nokia but I also wanted Android OS, and was told by Nokia that it was not available on their phones. My Nokia was so old that I think it is like the one Elvis used. Anyway, it had a rotary dial.As I say, so far so good. The biggest drawback, as mentioned by many others, is the number of apps icons that need purging - I won't use all of them, maybe three or four. I have had a T-Mobile prepaid plan since 2007, so converting this phone to that plan was not too difficult. My Nokia SIM card was not recognized by the Samsung, for whatever reason, so I first copied my ""contacts"" from the Nokia SIM card to the Nokia memory. I then placed the Exhibit II SIM card(the one that came with the package) into the Nokia and copied the contact info to the new SIM card. This card was then placed into the Exhibit II and viola! It didn't recognize the existence of a SIM card. What now?After fumbling around a bit and recalling how often I have had to reboot the set-top box for my Fios service, I said, ""Aha!"" I removed the battery and reinstalled it - We now have ignition. So, I signed up for another 1000 minutes on my plan and I'm good to go.One disappointment - and maybe it's just me - but I connected the Exhibit via the mini USB, to my iMac and the iMac did not recognize the device. If anyone is knowledgeable about this connection, please advise.For now, it looks like I take the phone to work to download the necessary drivers and apps required to ""root"" the unwanted apps icons as directed by others on this review site.Not having had any other ""smart"" phone to judge this one by, I think I am going to really enjoy this phone. However, I don't text at all (not yet anyway), and I don't intend to watch movies or TV, but it might be nice to sync with my computer at home, via Evernote, once I figure out how to get it on board.Hope some of this will help others with whatever they are considering in the way of a new phone.EDIT: So far, not so good. I continue to be unable to remove the App icons.....even though I have a gmail account, I can't even download the Superoneclick App recommended here, to root it. Too much the neophyte to know whether it is the phone, me, or the prepaid T-Mobile plan, that is the source of the frustration. The next step is to beg the guys at T-Mobile for direction. So we will remain at 5 stars, for now.And, to the person, JJ, who wants my old Nokia, sorry that rotary phone sold on Creg's List for a song-and-dance.gydancer","990","Samsung","8"

"7695","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","It has been 1.5 month since I bought this item. It is time to make a fair judgement now.[Appearance]----------------This is good looking device with thin design. Screen size is 3.7 inch.[Usage]----------------Exhibit II is quite light. It feels good in hand. You mostly need to use your both hands to handle because of Android's menu and virtual keyboard design.[Speed]----------------It takes about a minute to boot device which is reasonable I guess. This is not fast device even it has 1 GHz processor. Because processor speed is an illusion in Android devices. Don't get fulled by numbers, just think about what you get. If you compare Samsung Exhibit II with iPhone which has equivalent hardware you will understand what I mean. My conclusion is Android is much slower operating system than iPhone. What you pay is what you get.[Camera]----------------Front cam is an ordinary one that is reasonable for video calls. Rear camera is 3MP with flash support. Photo quality is not fancy but not too bad at all.[Operating System]----------------This device is running Android Gingerbread(2.3.x). Android is Java dependent system which makes it running slow. However it is still better than Windows based mobile operating system. You can experience weird resets sometimes don't worry. There is no news about Android 4.0 update. I guess they may not prepare 4.0 update for Exhibit II.[Connectivity]----------------3G/4G networks are available for internet connection. Bluetooth is available for data exchange.[Software]:----------------t is coming with bunch of useless T-Mobile software. You cannot directly remove them they are defined as system component. You need to root and remove them. You will use Android Market for new software. Android Market is still poor if you compare it with iPhone apps.[Battery life]----------------This part is really crucial. I bought this device to use 4G service. That is why I always enable either WiFi or 4G. Data backup and synchronization services are always running too. Average battery life is 20 hours for me. But there is a significant inconstancy in battery consumption. I usually use similarly each day but sometimes battery is draining in 8 hours, but rarely it is draining in 30 hours. I have no idea about that.[GPS/Navigation]----------------At the beginning GPS signal was frequently dropping but it is quite consistent nowadays. Use Google Navigation software. It is much better software than other navigation software which comes default.[Conclusion]----------------First off all you need to know that you are not buying an iPhone equivalent smart phone. I don't know the whole market but this might be one of the best smart phones in terms of performance/cost. If disadvantages don't bother you too much this might be right smart phone for you.I hope this review is helpful for you.","990","Samsung","8"

The calender & task application are weak - unable to set a proper alert or a pop-up reminder. So if you need those features in a phone, this one is not your best option.3).

"7698","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","I absolutely love my camera. It works very well and almost everything I hoped for. Only two problems I had was it has no zoom. I saw in the product description it was to have x3 zoom, and it does NOT. I even spoke with Samsung and they confirmed it. Also, I was under the impression that I could get the $30 unlimited text and web with 100 mins. I was wrong. That card is ONLY available if you bought the phone through walmart. So now I have to do the $50 one, or only have 30 GB of internet. Other than those two, I love the phone and would recommend it. Only thing I would have done differently was spend the extra $20 and got it at walmart instead.","990","Samsung","8"

"7700","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","For the price, this is a fairly decent phone. I switched from Blackberry, so I miss the physical keyboard, and small size of my BB.Size: As Android phones go, this phone is one of the smaller ones. It is almost the exact same size as the iphone, and even has a larger screen than the iphone. Screen size to phone size ratio is among the best around.Weight: AverageSpeed: Web browsing is fast. The phone sometimes takes 3-4 seconds to load the page with my corporate email - seems like a long time when you are staring at the screen. Other than that it seems ok.Battery: Terrible. But as I understand, all newer phones are like that - wish they would take a page from Blackberry and get a clueInternal memory: I've downloaded a few apps and seem to have more than enough memory left.Software: Phone installed an update the second day I had it, so it runs Gingerbread. It came with all sorts of preloaded software I don't want, but since I seem to have plenty of memory left on the phone I'm not worried about it.Other: You have to download stuff and tweak settings to get it to do what you want, and it does not always comply. I'm usually quite technically adept, but I set this thing to receive push email, and now for some reason it is not downloading new emails from my gmail. So there is some setting messed up. It is not like a blackberry, where everything just worked, but I think that is Android, not this particular phone.Accessories: Phone did not come with a memory card, but has alot of internal memory. Came with a USB cable and with a very nice (very small) wall charger, and a SIM card.Delivery: Took Amazon 5 business days to get the thing out of their warehouse - it just kept stating status was ""shipping soon."" But once it shipped, it arrived in less than 18 hours.7/21 EDIT TO ADD: I am using this prepaid phone on a regular post paid TMobile plan, and it works just fine. Just put in my own SIM card, called TMob and asked them to change my plan from Blackberry to regular data (no cost difference on my plan), and it works. This was the least expensive option for me; TMob wanted $329 to buy the phone outright from them; Amazon was $189.Edit 7/21: Have had the phone a little over 2 weeks now. Battery life is MUCH better if you physically turn off the device each time you are done using it - press button on upper right side. I was not used to having to do this, as my Blackberry either turned itself off, or somehow did not use as much power. Physically turning it off, I can get through a day on the battery. Part of saving battery life is setting display brightness to about 5%, screen time out to 1 min, and touch key light to 6 seconds. The 5% brightness is more than sufficient inside, but I cannot see the screen when outside. Will have to find an app that adjusts brightness when outside. Also, this particular android model has no LED light, so the phone lacks the visual notification that there is a new email or voice mail (ie like the BB blinking light). I solved that by downloading an app called ""NoLED"" which is terrific, and even shows the time on the screen. I'm getting used to the size of the phone; it is not as much of a problem as I anticipated, but still larger than my BB Pearl. Other issues are all Android issues, but I'm getting used to them or solving them. Gmail problem is solved, and a free app called ""SMS Unread"" can be downloaded and configured to show the number of unread emails in each gmail account.Update 12/22: At the five month mark, I'm reasonably satisfied with this phone. Biggest complaint about this phone is it's ridiculously terrible battery life. I think this a shortcoming of non-Blackberry phones (ie all Android & Iphones) and not this specific phone. A colleague who went from Blackberry to Iphone has the same problem. As a result of the poor battery life, my screen is set to the absolute lowest brightness, so I can't see anything on the phone when in the car or outside (anything subject to natural light), which is the second worst thing about the phone. I probably use less than 45 minutes a day of cell, and check it occasionally; battery really should last longer and allow for brighter screen setting so it can be seen in a car. Third on list of gripes is that it is not as fast as my friends Iphone5, but it is not a $700 phone either. I'll keep the $520 I saved and wait a few seconds for the phone to respond to certain commands. I'm told this is because the memory is filling up; I'd like a way to get rid of all the preloaded programs for which I have no use. Rooting will do this, but the root procedure for this model supposedly breaks it's ability to call 911, so I'm not interested in that.On the ok side, the picture quality is better than my BB, not stellar, but not bad enough to change phones. Seems lately to have developed a problem connecting via USB to the computer to download pics, but that might be Android, not this model of phone. I've also had an issue where I try to dial a number and it immediately disconnects. I pull the battery and let it restart and everything works fine. I don't know if this is caused by the phone, the OS or Tmobile.On the plus side, I've dropped it numerous times and the screen does NOT crack like iphones do. I find this one of the major advantages. The other advantage that I LOVE is the TMo Wifi calling - as long as I have a wifi connection, the cell part of the phone makes and receives calls regardless of the strength of cell coverage. Third advantage (silver lining in the cloud?) is that even though it does not have a hard keyboard (which I miss), it comes preloaded with ""swype"" for entering your text/numbers. This works pretty well, and makes entering text bearable, and apparently a feature like this does not come preloaded on iphones, because a few iphone users have marveled at this feature. I have no issues with sound quality on the cell, both regular and on speaker phone, and internet connection seems to work at a nice clip. Web pages are displayed crisply, so screen resolution is good.Overall, I'm pleased with the phone and pleased with the price.","990","Samsung","8"

"7702","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","3","Heard sour remarks from friends abt the Samsung android phones tendency yo freeze up. Three days of owing this phone, it stopped working as it should. Had missed calls because the phone just froze, and i wasnt aware until i got an iMsg on my iPad that i was MIA. Upon checking the phone, i see that i could not use the touch screen, i forced a shutdown, and after numerous attempts to force a reboit ( i held the power button for many many seconds) it did turn on after abt five tries!Now i was warned prior to looking for a new phone.Other notables:Screen reacts to daytime light in a bad way, u have to be inside to see the screen as it is a virtual mirror when outdoors.Small keypad makes for slow data entry and errorsVoice feature offsets the keypad issue above. In fact i would say its the coolest feature of the phone.Useless apps cant be hidden, like grayed out...if anyone knows how o, please leave a comnent.Not intiitive as iDevices, had to read the manual for simple tasks such as applying a pic to a contact, and swiping ( default call answering ) to answer a call. I promptly found a way to reassign the Home key to answer calls.Another cool feature is joining contacts. Allows u to EASILY join or unjoin your cobtacts as one in your contact list. If you have the same contact under diff names or from diff places like, linkedIn, FB, Google...So i am giving the phone 3 stars because i prefer substance over form.

"7703","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","2","I only had it for less than a week, but I'm really digging this phone. It's my first smart phone, so I'm not speaking with tons of experience.There is a bunch of bloatware on this phone. I installed the ZergRush root:(...)And then Titanium Back-up app which allows backing-up to the SD card and removal of all the crap.Worked great. Still exploring all the capabilities this phone has.The voice recognition seems to work really well. I've used it a few times with the Google search function when I didn't feel like typing.It has locked-up once while surfing the web which required a battery pull. Re-booted with no ill-effects.A primary attraction to this phone was the availability of T-mobile's $30/mo 100 min/unlimited text and data plan. I wanted a smart phone on a monthly plan, but not the typical $70/mo charge you've got with a contract. For me, this is an ideal package as I'm not a big talker.That being said, read the fine print. This plan is only available via Walmart and T-mobile.com. The catch is that going through either of these sources makes it difficult or impossible to port your old number.To activate my phone, I called T-mobile's porting resolution number at 877-789-3106. They activated my phone and ported my old number, but then despite my request, set me up with the $50/mo unlimited plan. I had to call customer service and do some arm twisting to get on the ""Walmart plan"".In hindsight, it may have been easier to have paid an extra 10 bucks and bought the phone from Walmart.8/8/2012 UPDATE:This sucker runs HOT. Gets pretty warm while websurfing and streaming. Gets scalding hot while running Navigation. It's locked up a few times while running navigation. Pretty much the worst time to have to shut down and restart your phone (while driving).This last time when trying to restart, I got a message stating the battery was too hot, or something to that effect. I've started removing the case when using the Navigation.I'm pretty sure these symptoms are leading up to premature battery failure. Time will tell. Might try a different case to alleviate the issue.Other than that, I'm really happy with the phone.7/22/14 UPDATE:Final update. I dumped this phone about 6 months ago. It began to crash, restart and just plain shut down indiscriminately. Part of the problem may have been the SD card, it just didn't have the processing power to handle anything but the simplest apps. Biggest offender might be the latest Facebook updates. Any GPS app also will freeze it up instantly. My wife still has her phone of the same model, and we're getting ready to dump it too for the same issues.This model it just plain obsolete in 2014, and I would not recommend purchasing one at any price. It worked marginally well for the first six months, but after that, it became a turd.The good news is my new Moto X works awesome and I was able to seamlessly transfer my $30/mo 4G plan.","990","Samsung","8"
"7704","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","I bought this phone about six months ago. I decided to wait until I have used it for a while so that I can report on my success stories. Unfortunately, the phone stopped accepting or making calls about a month ago. After spending about an hour on the phone (another phone) with TMobile and then an hour with Samsung , I was permitted to send the phone to Samsung for repairs. After about 3.5 weeks, I received my phone, and it has not been fixed. I just got off the phone with Samsung again, and I am on my way to send the phone back to Samsung again. I hope that this time either they really really fix it, or they would replace it. In the meantime, I will probably be without the use of my phone for another 3-4 weeks.Update,After four separate repair cycles, and a three month delay, Samsung decided not to repair the unit anymore and send me a replacement. Unfortunately, the replacement is an older used phone, which was probably returned by another customer due to its own set of defects. I am now watching the phone anxiously to discover the defects of this phone, two of which I have already discovered.Needless to say, I am not happy with the purchase of this phone.Final UpdateThe so called working replacement from Samsung died five months later. All told, I had 11 months of mediocre use from this purchase.ReflectionIt appears that, if one gets a defective phone, the Samsung repair department might actually hasten the demise of the phone.","990","Samsung","8"
"7705","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","The Samsung Exhibit II is a solid and attractive upgrade phone for pre-paid users. Like many, I started out using a low-end LG Optimus V on Virgin Mobile, but soon tired of the slow data and bloatware of the phone. Looking around T-Mobile's Monthly 4G plans were 5 dollars cheaper and twice the data cap (2.5GB versus 5GB before throttling kicks in). HSPA+ was also amazingly fast - at least 3x the average speed of VM's 3G. But the problem was that T-Mobile's 4G Phones are pricey, even for the up-front cost that pre-paid users expect to shell out to get to a new phone. Looking around, I discovered Amazon was selling them for much less. The reviews seemed pretty positive, so I took the plunge and was glad I did. Although many of us dream of picking up a top of the line HTC or Samsung Galaxy, this phone was a big upgrade to my older OV. A larger and higher-resolution screen, much more responsive just in terms of scrolling and launching apps, and I wasn't constantly watching my disk space when loading apps because of the generous 4GB onboard storage. I did add an 8GB MicroSD so I could easily carry around my music and videos. Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase - I just wish there were more accessory options for it like a good Otterbox case and clip, but for under USD200, you can't beat this phone as a good mid-range Android.","990","Samsung","8"

Fortunately I found the following tutorial online on how to root the phone:[...]Once you root the phone you will need to use the android market app(already installed on the phone) to download the ""titanium backup"" app. I used this to remove all of the garbage from the phone.

Sent that back and was looking at a prepaid phone when I ran across this Samsung Exhibit II here at Amazon.I guess it was my lucky day cause this phone is great! Got fast 2 day shipment and activating it at T-Mobile was a snap. Because I was a NEW customer I was able to get the $30 a month plan with 100 minutes, unlimited text and unlimited web. Oh yea, NO 2 year contract! This beats the heck out of those other guys.There is alot of bloatware that everyone mentions but I reduced the number of homescreens from 7 to 3 and put those apps I useon those 3 screens. Also downloaded Juice Defender and Android Booster from the app store to help me with battery and app management. Next I downloaded the Kindle ap and got my books downloaded. Then I downloaded music from my Amazon Cloud player and stored it on the phone.I had a 16gb SD card which I installed and then moved some of the apps to the card which saves space on the internal battery.

"7720","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I got the Exhibit II as a secondary phone. This is a really very good phone for $189.Pros:- Screen size is 3.7"". Not too shabby for a sub-$200 phone. It has multi-touch and screen detailing is crisp.- Decent specs with a single-core 1.0 GHz processor and 4 Gigs of internal memory.- Front-facing camera for video conferencing!! This is what sold me on the phone - the ability to skype or video-gtalk is really nice.- Very good battery life. The phone will easily take you through the day with average use - I get 30 to 40 hours on a single charge.Cons:- You have to deal with a lot of T-mobile bloatware. Of course you can always root the phone and delete most of the bloatware.- T-mobile may give you a very hard time unlocking the phone as it is not purchased through them. Since I travel overseas a lot I needed my phone unlocked. I have read that some individuals have eventually gotten t-mobile to unlock their Exhibit II after several calls. I wasn't that lucky so I had to go elsewhere to unlock mine for about $25.Other:- If you are buying this phone to unlock it and use overseas, check to be sure your network is compatible- For the Exhibit II we have:2G Network GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 19003G Network HSDPA 850 / 1700 / 2100 / 1900- Several countries in Africa and Europe use 900/1800 which means this phone will only get 2g on those networks.

All I had to do was call T-Mobile and tell them that I no longer needed a Blackberry data plan and needed their Android one.Pro's:-It's easily rootable. All one has to do is download some drivers for your computer, some app's, and voila. You're done. In fact, rooting your device is encouraged by many in the Android community; unlike those who own iOS devices (Apple actually frowns upon people who do so).-Plenty of apps that you would find on Apple's devices, you can easily find on Android. For example, Siri. Instead, we Android users have something called Iris.-Unlike Apple products, this Android phone actually has a flash for its' camera. Since I take plenty of pictures, I expect my camera's to have flash.Con's:The one thing that really bothers me about this phone is that I couldn't hear people text me when I had the phone locked. With my Blackberry, it would make a noise. It's not a big gripe since I was able to find an app on the Market that took care of this for me. It's called Handcent SMS in case anyone is interested.Otherwise, this phone is perfect!","990","Samsung","8"
"7722","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","Great phone so far after one week, really quite amazing for the price. We have been searching for phones that will switch over to wifi smoothly for talking AND texting, which seems simple but it has not been all that easy. We live outside of any cell phone service area, so this feature is essential. This one works great. We popped in our existing t-mobile sim card (family plan) and it activated without having to talk to anyone at T-mobile. Battery life is a bit short--you won't be able to go for days but it hasn't been a problem.Only other glitch is that the phone will occasionally buzz non-stop if Skype is on and you get a text or something.","990","Samsung","8"
"7723","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","This is a great quality phone with a decent screen size. I was initially afraid it might be a bit too small. I went from a 3.2 inch screen to a 3.7 in screen. Who knew half an inch would make all the difference! Although a 4 inch screen would be nice, I think this screen size is perfect. Not too small. It fits great in the hand.Text Messaging is buggy. If you text more than 1 page of text, it gives you an error. Looks like a lot of people have this problem. I've searched countless forums about it. The only way around it is downloading a different messaging app. The only annoyance is that I can set the new app as my default, but I can't change the icon on the dock to go to my app. The dock icon just goes back to the default messenger. There are apps that change your phone screen and it allows you to customize your dock, but I haven't found one that I like yet.Yes, the phone does come with A LOT of bloatware. I read about this before I purchased the phone. I read many forums and a group finally made the process easy. I am definitely new to the whole rooting process. I wanted to root my old Android phone but it seemed so complicated so I never went through with it. For this phone, there are some smarties out there that made the whole process so simple! Very few and simple steps. Download 2 files (USB drivers and the actual Rooting file), set phone to USB debugging, plug it in, execute rooting and you're done! Install titanium back up app, back up all apps (Just in case you delete the wrong one!), delete the apps that are not needed (List provided by the genius root people). SO EASY! I was a little hesitant in rooting because I was a newbie, but it's super easy and simple. The phone works just fine without rooting. It didn't lag or drain the battery. I went a whole day with moderate use during my work hours and heavy use on wifi when I got home. I still had some juice left the next morning. I only rooted the phone because all the extra apps annoyed me. I didn't want pages and pages of apps that I don't use.I'm still under contract with t-mobile but I wanted a newer smart phone. I had an old T-Mobile MyTouch. The very first version of the MyTouch line. I wanted to upgrade to a bigger and gingerbread android phone but I didn't want to be tied to a 2 year data plan. This is a great alternative to very pricy unlocked phones. Plus, when my contract is up, I can switch to the prepaid plan. I don't need data because I'm usually at home or at work where wifi is available so it's great that I could buy this phone, stick in my sim and I'm good to go. The only issue is that if you don't have a data plan you can't send picture messages. I have read this is an issue with Android and/or T-mobile. It doesn't bother me too much because I don't usually picture messageRegarding that other reviewer that said the phone can't get network calls or texts while on wifi, I don't know what's wrong with their phone but mine works great. I was hesitant to buy the phone because of that review. I'm glad I believed it to be a fluke and bought the phones anyway. Network calls DO work with wifi on. There's absolutely no reason it shouldn't. T-mobile told that person the wrong information!This phone is definitely slippery as other have said. The full body skin helped with that (Offered as a bundle from Amazon). Installation was SUPER easy. I like the soapy water method because it's more forgiving when you place it down crooked. Now I'm just waiting for my case from ebay.Overall it's a zippy phone (even before rooting), way faster than my ancient MyTouch running on Froyo. Very few lags and no ""force closes."" It has the perfect screen size and customizing is so easy. Battery life is great (I was afraid it would be like other smart phones where you charge every 12-15 hours). I am still heavily playing around with it, downloading and customizing, but I would say that I could probably get 2-3 days of regular use. For now, it's what I need for a price I can afford. This is a great phone!","990","Samsung","8"
"7724","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I see this phone as a one for those of us who love the idea of having all that technology in our pockets, but just can't get ourselves to spend hundreds of dollars on a top-of-the-line phone and/or go under a two year contract when plans and deals are changing almost everyday.I upgraded myself to this phone from a T-Mobile (Huawei) Comet, which probably was the lowest spec'ed phone you could get with Android 2.2 installed on it. I used Comet for little less than a year and I got it for 160 bucks - which I thought was a good deal back then, when rest of the options available were at least twice as expensive.Comet was very slow; when I saw Exhibit II for less than 200, I knew it was time for an upgrade.Exhibit II has all the good features that you read on here - which are excellent for the price.Here are the downfalls:1. 1.0 GHz processor is really great, but it is a single core; thus, some (quite little) choppiness or loss of smoothness is observed when you are multi-tasking - insignificant downfall.2. Android 2.3 appeared to me to be less stable than 2.2, as Exhibit II did freeze a couple of times after doing updates or installs and uninstalls. Not that I'm an expert, but I'd say this is expected, because 2.3 is more extensive, more compatible, more versatile. These freeze ups could also be a cause of some on-the-poor-side hardware.. but this is totally a guess.3. Screen is great, camera is borderline good (nothing amazing).. but I'd say, the sound quality is poor, with the most obvious one being the speaker on the back of the phone. It is loud and clear, but lacks depth to the tunes it is playing - sound like cheap laptop speakers as opposed to good laptop speakers. Sad to say (for Exhibit), Comet has a much better speaker (and this is one of the reasons why I'm not throwing Comet away). In addition, I can easily say that the earpiece inside the phone is not a lower-end quality one. The sound is overall is good but just not brilliant - wouldn't expect this from Samsung.Overall, it's a great phone - fast, functional, average up-to-date technology.. but we all know how long that lasts..I would recommend this phone.","990","Samsung","8"
"7725","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","3","I ordered this off amazon, tax free, with two day shipping. Arrived in a timely manner, but just got to activate it this morning. Activation is very simple. The kit includes a sim card, which you just insert above (and to the left) of the battery in the back. Then you will want to go to t-mobile.com/activation and follow the instructions. It comes with a random $3.34 balance.. for emergency.. instant calling or something I suppose. But following the activation, it takes you to where you can pay for your service online. You can also get those cards at the store, but honestly, it's so easy just to pay online. And then you're good to go. I chose the $30 unlim text/data + 100 min plan. You don't need to go to walmart or tmobile to get this. To my understanding, it is only available for new activations.The price and quality of the phone is all great. One problem I have with it is that... honestly... I'm not really an Android fan. I didn't think I would mind it at all but somehow it really annoys me how much bloatware it comes with. Sure, there are ways to delete it. But people on reviews made it sound 100x easier than what I had to do. I don't really consider myself technologically challenged, but it was hard to find all the steps to uninstall this crap I didn't want. You can't just go to the ""APPLICATIONS"" menu and drag what you don't want to the trash. Why? Everything I've tried to delete just stays there when I go back to the menu. What the hell is that function for then? Why can I not just delete the stuff I don't want? (And there are many.)I'm new to Android so rooting was a brand new concept for me. I must have downloaded 4 different apps off the Android market to no avail. I didn't understand why the hell something called ""______ Uninstaller"" cannot uninstall apps. After a bit of research and trying a bunch of different things, I finally figured it out.I figure I'd type it out in layman's terms for those who have trouble rooting:- Turn on USB debugger (settings>applications>development>usb debugging)- Have the right USB drivers installed ON YOUR COMPUTER (Apparently these are difficult to find. Install the samsung galaxy x drivers from softpedia instead. When I did this, it told me it wasn't installed correctly but I couldn't find a fix so I just ignored it.)- Connect your phone to the computer via usb port- Then you can download SuperOneClick on your COMPUTER. It is a computer application. Extract (it is a zip file) and run. Click on ""root."" (top left big button) It may take a couple minutes. It should say root complete or whatever at the end. And to confirm that it is indeed rooted, you will see a ""Superuser"" icon in the applications folder.- Now you can begin the uninstallation, but that is not all! You have to download some more stuff to uninstall. From the Android market, you can find some apps that will allow you to uninstall items. Android Mate was too advanced for me. You have to know exactly what files you are deleting (which is a constant annoyance.) If you delete the wrong files then your phone might not work or it will brick. Kind of terrifying, considering the price I paid. I used Titanium backup to uninstall items, but you still run the risk of deleting things you need. It is better to ""freeze"" the apps but that is a premium feature, which you must pay for. I also tried Root Uninstaller to no avail. It didn't show any apps besides Market and itself for some reason. I'm sure there's something out there that might be better but, so far, my experience is that these apps are not that user-friendly.Others have claimed that the process above is ""easy"" but it wasn't for me, apparently. Maybe some people know how to do this intuitively, I don't know. But think about it. All I wanted to do was delete pre-installed junk like internet radios and ""MORE FREE APPS!@!!"" apps. But it took entirely way too long. You can just press on any app in iOS until it's shaking and then press X to delete. A couple seconds, max. I don't understand why it is so hard to delete things on the Android (not even including the risk of bricking your phone at every corner.)Aside from my long rant, in the end, it is a good deal for a 4g smartphone and great rates on plans. Still, I'm not too satisfied with Android. I feel like it's one of those apple vs. windows commercials, comparing efficiency. There's a pre-installed anti-virus (free trial for 14 days, then you have to pay). Really? I never even thought that would be an issue with iOS. Obviously these are my opinions, and others will have no problems with the bloatware. I'm a bit OCD and inefficiency is such an annoyance. I just want my phone to run as efficiently and quickly as possible, not having junk on it that tries to make me install more apps or pay for premium services. Yes, the iphone costs way more, but I would still rather have it than Android. That's just me though.EDIT:After a few days of use, I'm getting used to the Android system more. I don't mind it as much, and hopefully it will hold up well. It's still a fantastic deal, and with no contracts none-the-less! In the end, the savings are fantastic. Think about the activation fees and taxes and whatnot when you have to get a phone with a contract. This phone is really a smart purchase.","990","Samsung","8"

I put the Simple Mobile Sim card and it accepted it perfectly. I had to manually set up the APN (which is very easy and Simple Mobile explains how to do on their website). I was also able to successfully root the phone using the ZergRush method. After rooting the phone I installed Titanium Backup to remove all of T-Mobile's bloatware from the stock ROM.Since I am using Simple Mobile's $40 2g/3g plan I disabled the 4G to double the battery life.The phone itself is very snappy and the images are very crisp. The front camera works great with Google+ and Skype so you should be able to video chat without any problems. The rear camera could be better since it only has 3.2 MP but with the help of a good camera app you can add filters and enhance the pictures.It is definitely the best 4G T-Mobile or Simple Mobile phone you can buy for under $200.","990","Samsung","8"

This no-contract phone at $190 (Amazon price on May 26 2012) is a great buy for the features it has.I bought this for my 12 year old as an upgrade to her non-smartphone and she's loving it. Has loaded bunches of games on it and hasn't had any trouble with any of them after about 10 days.The suggested retail for the Exhibit II is $330. At that price, it's actually a very poor value considering the Samsung GNex is now going for $400.Compared to the $150 (Amazon price) T-Mobile Prism, the Exhibit II is a far better phone.Jan 14 2013 edit: There is a Samsung Android update for this phone that rebrands the phone ""Galaxy Exhibit 4G"" (maybe some improvements/fixes in there too but I didn't look into the update). After nearly a year, the phone still works fine but she occasionally (maybe twice a month) experiences the homescreen icons vanishing (no lockups or crashes that I'm aware of) which is fixed by a reboot. The Galaxy Nexus (GNex) I mentioned in the 3rd paragraph is no longer available and has been replaced by the top of the line Nexus 4 at $299 (8Gb) or $349 (16Gb).Apr 3 2013 edit: Still operating fine with the notations from Jan 14 but I'm deducting 1 star because the ""value"" of the phone has gone down as it ages while the price remains pretty stable.

But the battery was exhausted very quick so I gave it back.Then I found this one surfing the T-mobile site for a new plan. Samsung is also a favorite brand and at the first view it seems to have everything that I like / need:- not too big (3,7"") but very good res of 800x480- nice appearance- expandale memory (up to 32 GB)So I decided to buy it with the monthly plan for $30 with 100min talk and rest unlimited.I like this phone very much but there are some things to mention.- You can't get this phone / plan in a T-mobile shop. They treated me not like a customer. When I stepped into the shop it took them a while to realise that a customer is there (there was nobody else). Then they just said I can order it only online. Also the SIM card. So I ordered the SIM card at T-mobile online and the phone at Amazon bc it cost $249 at T-mobile (one day later ist was $349!).But what I didn't know was that the SIM card is included in the package. This is not mentioned here!!! (Fortunately the SIM card is only $2.49 + tax or so)- The battery is exhausted also within a day even if I do not play surf or text (much) and the brightness is as low as possible. GPS and WiFi is turned off. I can't believe it. But it seems that I have to get used to it. My ""stupid"" phones only need to be charged once a week!- sometimes it is slow (ie playing angry birds or writing a text) although I only run one or two apps. Is the single core from Qualcomm so slow? Or as there an update running?- I assumed that 4G is faster. But it may depend on where I am. (ie. in a building with thick walls...)- Tethering: Not working with the monthly plan (100min voice, unlimited text, unlimited data (up to 5GB with 4G). This said the guy in a store.

"7759","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I've had this phone for 2 months.The Phone:Solid phone. Its great because its not pushing any technology envelope, its really reliable and consistent. Its technologically similar to the EVO 4g, so plenty fast for most everything. And actually the EVO has the Snapdragon S1 processor and this has the Snapdragon S2, slightly newer processor. But its also a technology that they've been working with for over a year so all the kinks seem to have been worked out.I'd rather have a 1ghz phone that works every time I need it than a dual-core 1.2ghz that fritzes out, turns on and off, gets hot, and does random stuff.The size is great. I don't really want my phone to dominate my pockets... The screen size works very well. I watch netflix on it regularly, email, web pages load really well and are easy to navigate, games are good. Texting is easy. I like the swype. Its improved smooth and quick.And at $200 I'm not so worried about it. Can you imagine carrying a $400 object in your pocket! I'd think about it all the time. This is way lower stress and a gain in workability.+Music player works great. Good sound without any enhancements.+I like how they do the calendar and the day's appointments are displayed below the monthly calendar.+Contacts software is well integrated and usable.+Being able to create folders inside the app menu is nice.-I liked the text msgr until I realized it cut photos sent thru MMS down to 9kb, can't even see them. So I use GO Messaging from App market. It only cuts them down to 30kb. Which is very readable. (I didn't like Handcent because when monitoring memory usage with the apps open, Handcent took up more memory and left more memory tied up even after I closed it.)+It has Tasklist and Memo apps that are well thought out.+The pull-down bar lets you change screen orientation, wifi on/off, bluetooth settings. Very handy.+Photo gallery loads quick.-Camera kind of sucks. Its usable for quick pictures and sharing good times, but I'm not going to print them out and frame them.+Skype works!! Well it doesn't work from the phone to a computer for some reason. But it works great from phone to phone. Had a great chat with my Brother on his EVO 4g.+They send you Txt reminders for making the prepaid payment on time starting 3 days before they're due.**Wifi Calling is installed and works great but it uses your minutes. Originally I thought I would get a minutes plan to save money and use wifi calling as much as possible but no-can-do. Wifi is just a way to get you service in low service areas. It still uses your minutes, so I moved to the unl minutes plan.I will say the less apps you put on a phone the better they run. The App Market is just not as well managed as Apple's App Store. The Apps in the Market can take up excessive memory, create memory leaks that increase the memory they take up even when closed, they conflict sometimes with other apps due to the access privileges they require, they slow the phone down.I watch carefully thru a memory monitoring app and see what apps do to the phone system and delete those that cause issues.I can get 3 days out of this phone's battery this way.Fortunately, which is something I love about this phone, most of the software I use is on the phone and it works really well. I'm very happy with it.The Service:I switched from Sprint. I'm glad I did. I paid $200 for the phone and now just pay the prepaid 4g monthly of $50/mo. I get unlm talk and text and 100mb of data at 4g and then unlimited data at 2g/3g. Its good for the occasional Navigated trip and getting emails (w/o attachments). Otherwise I just use wifi at home or office or friends. Easy enough and only $50/mo. Huge savings over Sprint/Vzn/ATT. And T-mobile has been pleasant to work with. I'm in Savannah, GA and service is great.","990","Samsung","8"
"7760","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","I purchased this phone because of it's ability to tether my computer via Wifi Hotpot. I signed up for the $60 per month-to-month-unlimited plan with the first 2GB of 4G. Long story short you can't tether. I was even told by 2 customer service reps multiple times that it was included in my plan but they never managed to get it to working properly. Meaning every time I would turn on the hotspot I would navigate with my computer to google.com and it would redirect me to t-mobile.com.I am returning the phone under the 14 days buyer remorse and I canceled my account with T-Mobile (when I asked for a refund they hung up on me) apparently they don't give refunds for unused pay-as-you-go funds. I am writing this review so you don't loose $60 either...***** DONT BUY THIS PHONE IF YOU WANT TO USE THE WIFI HOTSPOT IT DOESN'T WORK AND T-MOBILE WON'T REFUND YOUR MONEY ******","990","Samsung","8"
"7761","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","This phone is the best performance per dollar smart phone for the people who can get TMobile HSPA+ connection. The HSPA+ data download and upload speed are 3Mbps - 8Mbps and 500kbps - 3Mbps. If one is not on the HSPA+ network, the phone will switch to EDGE network, and the data download and upload speed will be reduced to 40kbps - 100 kbps and 40kbps - 120kbps. GroveIP + Google Voice combo do not work really good on Tmobile EDGE network because the data speed is way too slow. The GroveIP voice will either be lagging or breaking up and it's an unacceptable calling experience. The same result applies to Skype, however if one switch to a good Wifi network and then this wont be a problem. But we all know that using Wifi means you have to stick in that room, so don't even dream about driving and use GroveIP to call someone on a wifi network at the same time.Tmobile post paid call centers people are in US but the pre-paid ones are not. It may not be a fun experience to deal with the pre-paid customer agents. It took me about 4 hours to switch from a post-paid Tmobile account to a pre-paid $30 100 min, unlimited text and data plan. It is very tricky on how to move my post paid phone number to a pre-paid service and also select this $30 100 min unlimited plan.The default Tmobile Wifi calling app does use your own plan minutes when you make a call on a Wifi network. I think this is lame and it is wrong.The battery lasts about 2 days of usages if one is on EDGE network. The battery lasts less than 1/2 day if one uses HSPA+ and playing with video and music.I got this phone for about 2 weeks.The phone supports Tethering and Portable Hotspot but by default, Tmobile will block the service even if you have unlimited data plan. Additional cost is required to use this service.A screen protector is not needed. I just keep the original MFG plastic screen cover on and let a 9 years old kid to play Fruit Ninja for about 1 hour, as result, it works fine, no damage on the phone screen.The front phone cam produces really crappy image quality. But it is still useable to let others see you.As of Jan 19, 2012, I think this phone will not get Ice Cream Sandwich upgrade.Overall, this phone is not as good as iPhone 3GS, no where near iPhone4 and iPhone4S. But for $189, this is still the best value phone when using TMobile $30 100 minutes, unlimited text and unlimited data monthly plan.********************************************************************************************************Updated April 21, 2012Dial *#*#197328640#*#* and option 1->8->7->2->2 to use 3G/4G network only.Dial *#7465625# to see if the phone is locked or not.","990","Samsung","8"
"7762","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","In my opinion this is a horrible phone. The processor seems to be extremely slow between functions. Press on the message icon and sometimes it takes at least 5 seconds to come up. And the worst thing about this is that when u want to write a text the 'tap here to write' area is not sensitive enough. Occasionally it take 20+ taps to be able to pull up the key board to write. Very seriously considering ditching this phone. Also to get data, unless u are in a very good reception 4g area getting on line is almost impossible. Very frustrating. Another con is at the power power button is directly across the phone from the volume button so whenu power on or off u will also hit the volume button naturally. Poor layout. I do love the swipe function for texting though, that bit is awesome.Multiple times already I have had to take the battery out to get is phone back into life as it locks up or does whatever it's doing. Very frustrating.Already looking for a new phone, but if u feel $180 is a good deal then go for it, but it's very flawed!","990","Samsung","8"

"7764","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","It's been a good 3 or 4 years since I bought a cell phone. My old one was one of the original My Touch models which I absolutely loved when I got it. It had been run over and most of the color had been scratched off. So needless to say it was finally time to upgrade.My husband and I are researchers (and super frugal) so when it came time to say goodbye to the My Touch I really wanted to get a great phone for super cheap. The Amaze and Galaxy are all the rage right now but since I don't want a 2 year contract they're just really expensive phones to buy off the shelf. That meant we had to find a phone we felt was as close in quality as the Amaze or Galaxy but for half the price plus great functionality since I'm on the phone almost 20 hours a week for work.We did all our research and read all the reviews and made the choice that the Exhibit II was the ticket and boy were we right. I just got my phone yesterday and it looks great and functions even better!!! It functions very intuitively so no need to get out the manual. The speed is off the charts! I was able to get everything set up in 30 minutes or so and then just played with my new toy. I was so enthralled with it in fact that my husband had to gently remove it from my hands just so I'd go to sleep.Can't wait to use the phone for work today since I already know it's going to increase my productivity.","990","Samsung","8"
"7765","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","Let me start off by saying that I am not very tech-savy. I am on the Tmobile prepaid unlimited everything. I had been looking for an internet capable phone for quite sometime, as I was paying for a data plan I was not using. I purchased this phone after much research on android phones. What sold me on this phone was the price. Because I have the prepaid plan, I was going to have to pay in full for an unlocked android phone, which can be over $300. I found this phone on Amazon, and was imediatally in love with it, because it can everything that I wanted it to do and it was at an affordable price of $200.I like this phone for many reasons. It is a 4G capable phone so I get signal almost everywhere. I like the way that the texting is set up (gingerbread interface, I think that is what it is called). This phone comes preloaded with swype, which i had never used before until now. Swype is pretty easy to use I just drag your fingure across the letters in the word that I are trying to spell and it writes out the word for me, so no more hunt and peck. Another thing that I like about the phone is that it is wi-fi capable. I like many other things about this phone, these are just some examples.I have only had a cupple of problems with this phone. Sometimes the phone is not very responsive to my touches on the touch screen, though is rare. The only other problems that I have with the phone are that occasionally my phone will not send texts and rarely it will freeze up. Both of these problems are fixible by simply restarting the phone or pulling the battery. I have had no other problems with phone other than those things.Over all I think that this is a pretty nice andriod phone, and totally worth the money. It is a great deal for all the things that you get.","990","Samsung","8"

"7772","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","2","I bought this phone Jan 2013 . October 2013 running minimal apps , the phone began to exhibit ( no pun intended ) all of the worst characteristics described in myriad other 3 and 2 star reviews . Slow page loads , freezing or locking up , black screens , inability to complete calls in urban areas to name only a few . Aside from that it was almost impossible to nail down a rooting procedure that was less complicated than Newton's theory of relativity ! As if that wasn't enough it developed a behavior of turning itself off and on at will , and becoming very hot , while consuming all its battery power every 10-12 hours . Since I travel to various cities frequently this was not only unerving and frustrating , but a SERIOUS business communication handicap . I actually began to travel with an accessory battery charger and TWO spare batteries as well as the wall charger . Near associates were infinitely amused to observe me changing batteries in my phone once , or even twice ( on heavy use days ) while their phones remained stowed . All in all it was a great product until real service and current communication demands were placed on it . Then its performance diminishes and becomes irregular very , very , quickly . This will be a great phone for a user with only the most very basic demands ( i.e. basic talk - text and photos ) . I have since returned it to Samsung , where it was factory refurbished . In the meantime I purchased a Galaxy III with which I am quite pleased with and has absolutely no difficulty negotiating the same apps , and more that I had on the Exhibit 4G and very good battery life for a smart phone . The Exhibit all in all was not a bad phone . But if you are a heavy phone / data user you will outgrow this phone really fast , and subject yourself to a great deal of frustration .","990","Samsung","8"

It's embarrassing when my friends with iPhones are Googling or finding their way with their GPSes so much faster than me. It lagged when I needed it most. It power cycled at bad times. I suffered for about 3 months like this.Then I rooted it and installed Rebelrom 3.09 on it. Now it runs faster and smoother.

I'm not a pro or anything, but I know that this camera is not as great as some other reviews put it up to be.I expected this phone to be the best bang for my buck out of the box.

There's problems with it too like the lock screen clock shows a different time from the one in the corner on the menu/status bar.

Defiantly recommend it if you want something that looks nice, feels good and works great. I have had mine for almost a week and a half and the only thing that makes me disappointed is the pre-installed apps that you can not uninstall, also when I plugged it into my computer it took me awhile to figure out why it wasn't able to install the software for the phone, so I had to go (on the phone) into settings, then wireless and network then went down to USB utilities and had to connect the phone to the computer before I pressed ""turn on USB storage"". so that took awhile but now everything is good. 4g is great and fast too. The processor is fairly good, nice and fast. there's only some points where it lags in and out of messaging or any other icons, but that is usually when I haven't turned off the phone for a couple days and all I do is charge it when the battery gets low. but it is nice and responsive to the movement of your fingers, the screen is very nice and responsive also and surprisingly has not scratched yet. I have had this phone in and out of my pocket so much without a screen protector and still has no scratch, it does smudge a little but not much. The screen is also a bit bigger than the iPhone (long wise). the camera and front facing camera are actually pretty decent. if you keep them smudge and scratch free they do take some good pics, the front facing cam is pretty pixelly but isn't bad when your doing a Skype or snapchat. and now for the calling, the speaker/ear piece or whatever its called is very nice and has good sound. I have not tested the speaker phone feature yet but I play music out of it sometimes and its nice clear. Basically its a great phone for people who don't want to spend a whole lot on the phone or the service and mostly uses it for texting, calling, music, web and facebook, or any social app that's about it. if you want something that you can use all for media stuff and as a phone, iPhone or galaxy would be your best choices.","990","Samsung","8"

"7801","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","3","Correction on original comment:On 12/3/12, T-Mobile sent me two replacement handsets. Writing to the Customer Relation Department with relevant documentation was not a wast of time but effective. But, make sure you have sufficient documentation such as package tracking information in such exceptional situation. Although I would still recommend improvement in their software update quality and customer service department to streamline communication and processing of customer issues such that I would not have lost the use of my newly bought phone for more than four months with lots of frustration. I now changed the rating from 1 to 3.-----------------------I think I have the social responsibility to report my experience to potential customers:1. I purchased a new Samsung Exhibit II Smart Phone from Amazon.com for about $200 and it worked fine until a software update pushed to my handset by your company. The software update rendered the handset frozen, unusable. Therefore, if you do own a smart phone tied to T-Mobile, beware of the poor software quality pushed into your phone..2. I called technical support and the representative asked me to send in the handset for a replacement to: 4500 Cambridge Rd, Fort Worth TX, 76155. I sent in the handset via UPS according to the instructions with the order number posted outside and inside the shipping box.3. UPS delivered the handset promptly. Tracking information shows that the package was delivered to the dock of warehouse 07/12/2012 10:00 A.M.4. But, the replacement handset was not shipped to me within 7 business days as promised by the representative who asked me to send in the broken handset. After several calls to the Customer Representative Department and about one month later, the warehouse sent me email saying that no record was found in receiving my handset such that the replacement handset order cannot be fulfilled.5. After even more phone calls to the Customer Service, a supervisor who was relatively fair and honest and confirmed that UPS did deliver the handset to the warehouse. He cancelled the old handset replacement order and created a new order.6. Unfortunately, the order still could not be fulfilled for some unknown reasons. Again, after many phone calls after phone calls, the representatives could not help but asked me to verify that I did send in the handset. Finally, I asked UPS to give me additional proof of delivery. UPS performed an extra procedure called Package Investigation. UPS confirmed that the package was delivered with the name of the person receiving the package in the warehouse.7. As of today, the order was not honored but cancelled automatically by T-Mobile system.Most of the customer representatives I talked to seemed courteous but could not actually be helpful practically. In fact, they could not even keep their promises to call me back when they said they would after their investigation. Therefore, I had to explain the whole story when I called again but connected to another customer representative in the T-Mobile Call Center. Writing to the T-Mobile Customer Relation was also a waste of time. They simply ignored my letter. I think this company calculates that it is more profitable to provide poor customer server or even illegal business practice in certain cases such as replacing a smart phone broken by software update pushed into their customers' phones. After all, T-Mobile is a big company and its management is playing ""Catch Me if You Can"" game.","990","Samsung","8"

It's a good phone for making and receiving phone calls, texting, not so much for interactive data services. One thing I have found great about this phone is if you are interested in great quality music, try downloading the 'Poweramp' application at your app store. For a pittance, it turns the ho hum audio into a high end audiophile machine. I broke my old (4 month old) Exhibit from T Mobile, simply removed the SIM card, flash card, and kablamo, I was back in business. Now as to T Mobile itself, well, it's a 'starter' network. If you need business/ enterprise class calling/data service, try another network. This is a 'weekender' product and package.","990","Samsung","8"

"7821","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","3","Let me start this review my saying that I came from an old iPhone 3GS. While I enjoy the hardware and software quality of my Apple product, I did not at all enjoy the long-term expensive contract that came with it. I'm usually around areas with WiFi, so paying each month for a required data package didn't make much sense to me. I wanted a phone and carrier plan that met my needs, not the other way around.When my two-year contract expired I began researching various phones and carrier plans. I wanted a smartphone (Apple spoiled me there), but it didn't have to have all the bells and whistles. I mostly wanted something that could play music while on road trips and allow me to reliably call and text my buddies. The Exhibit II was the phone that seemed to meet all my needs.After owning the phone for a month I can say that it does a fairly decent job at meeting my needs. However, there are a number of flaws in the phone that make using it quirky and often irritating. Below are my general pro/con thoughts on the phone.Pros:The screen is noticeably brighter and of higher quality than my old iPhone. Everything looks crisp and detailed.The Exhibit II is a good bit lighter and less bulky than my iPhone. It feels much more at home in my pocket.I save $40 a month in comparison to my old AT&T bill. The phone will pay for itself in just five months.Flaws:The touchscreen is flat out not as responsive as my iPhone 3GS. I often have to touch or drag multiple times in order to get input to be registered. I get the impression that it is less a flaw of the touchscreen than the processor in the phone trying to keep up with my actions, for it feels somewhat laggy. With a 1GHz Snapdragon, however, I didn't expect such sluggishness.There is something wrong with the volume control when I attempt to make calls. If I toggle the volume up, nothing will happen. I discovered, with some experimentation, that I first have to press the volume control down before I can press it up to make it louder. This is very counter-intuitive and, frankly, annoying.There is a loud pop though the earpiece a few seconds after I press 'Send' to make a call. I have to hold the phone away from my ear to save my eardrums some pain.This phone has a good bit of bloatware installed. I thought Apple exercised tight control over their users, but I can't even delete the useless junk on my Exhibit II!3D games don't run all that well. Even simpler games such as Temple Run exhibit enough lag to stymie your gameplay experience.There is a significant delay between when I press the button to take a photograph and when that photograph is actually taken. The delay can be anywhere between one and four seconds. This is a major issue if you are tying to take a photograph in a pinch. More often than not you will miss that special moment.This isn't really a flaw in the phone itself, but I don't get very good service where I live. The TMobile map showed that I was in a lighter green, but I get more dropped calls and interference than what I did with AT&T.The Samsung Exhibit II runs an older version of the Andriod OS (Gingerbread), and it doesn't look like TMobile has plans to update the phone to Ice Cream Sandwich.The TMoible MyAccount Software will not work unless 'Use Packet Data' is enabled under 'Settings -> Wireless and network -> Mobile networks.' I generally keep Packet Data off so that I do not accidentally use data while out and about. It is annoying that I first must enable this to see how I am doing in terms of my minutes and text messages.Text messages occasionally fail to send. I sometimes have to attempt the send multiple times before it will go through.Other thoughts:This is just personal opinion, but Andriod feels much less polished than iOS. With my iPhone I never worried about restarting my device to keep it running well. My Exhibit II, on the other hand, reminds me every week or two that it is time to reboot the phone so that it can continue operating properly.Malware seems to be fairly rampant on the Andriod platform. I cringe at the thought of Malware getting on a heavy communication device such as my phone.Setting up my phone wasn't as smooth as I would like it to have been. I attempted to perform the setup through the TMobile web portal, but I continually got a message partway through stating that my account was 'processing' and that I should wait. After a couple days of waiting I called TMobile and painlessly set up my account through one of their agents.Conclusion:This is a decent phone if all you are looking to do is make a few calls, play music, and perhaps do minimal web browsing. If you are a heavy cell phone user and are looking for a phone that will play the latest games, text, run the latest software, and do heavy multimedia, then I recommend looking elsewhere.","990","Samsung","8"
"7822","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","I normally don't write reviews, but this phone is so horrible I must. I was led astray by the various glowing reviews I had seen here, and needed to replace my horrible Motorola Defy, and this seemed like the perfect fit. Unfortunately, this new phone is almost worst than the Defy was. It freezes ALL THE TIME, and like some of the other reviews have pointed out, is horribly unresponsive. I thought mine was defective, but after reading some of the recent reviews, realize that all the screens must be bad. The texting IS horrible, and lags so much. Not only that, but the back button sometimes doesn't take you to the main messaging screen, it takes you to another chat window with another person! Push back again, and another person! I get so frustrated texting, and sometimes, to text once, it'll take a good minute or so JUST to get to the text box. Ridiculous. I also have to constantly take out my battery because the phone keeps freezing. Just now, it wouldn't even let me take a phone call! Phone kept ringing like it was possessed, but only a blank screen. Sometimes, I just feel like throwing it against the wall and smashing it to pieces, it frustrates me so much. This phone deserves ZERO stars. Be a smart consumer and STAY AWAY. I sure wish I had.","990","Samsung","8"
"7823","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","Based off of previous experiences with Samsung products I thought this was a great deal, boy was I wrong. The phone constantly shuts off and repeatedly freezes. I don't believe the phone has enough RAM to support many high end games/apps available in the Android or Amazon Market. I would not recommend this phone to anyone.","990","Samsung","8"
"7824","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","Pros:Cheaper than iPhone.Call quality - not spectacular, but it usually works.Pretty good camera.No contract. Unlimited voice, text, and data with a prepaid T-Mobile plan.Cons:Sluggish keyboard response, especially in Facebook and text messaging. Often have to tap a button or text window several times before it responds.Unacceptably slow internet unless you are in an area with a strong 4G signal. Even when connected to wi-fi it will often wait 30 seconds then give a ""Lost connection"" message while my iPod Touch right next to it quickly loads the same page.Comes preloaded with more than twenty applications that you don't want, will never use, and can't uninstall. As long as you own this phone it is going to keep nagging you to update these applications that you didn't want in the first place.Summary:I regret buying this phone. For me, the disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. I will wait until the iPhone 5 comes out, bite the bullet and spend the extra money, then get rid of this thing on eBay for whatever I can get.Update 6/4/2012: I have now had this phone for almost two months and there are continuous problems:1. The phone reboots at random.2. The screen often locks up, forcing the user to reboot.3. Very slow internet and facebook with the screen stuck on the ""Loading"" icon for minutes (or forever). This occurs even when there is a good wi-fi connection.4. And the worst - failed text messages. Google ""tmobile text failed"" to see all the problems that people are having with this phone. When trying to send a text message, it comes back with a ""Failed"" error message. Sometimes it may work after several retries. Other times it never sends. Or worse, sometimes it does send, but gives you the ""failed"" message anyway. So you keep trying to send and the other person receives multiple copies.Changing from two stars to one star. I wish I could return this thing. I'm afraid it's too late now, but I am unlikely to ever buy another T-Mobile, Android, or Samsung phone after this bad experience.","990","Samsung","8"

"7826","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","For one I got this phone as my first affordable smartphone. I did not want to pay near $80 a month for LIMITED data on the networks that work near my house (ex: everyone but Sprint). I was able to activate it for my first month under T-mobile's $30 no contract plan. As a warning..the ONLY way you can get that plan is buy activating the phone online OR buy buying and activating the phone at a Walmart that is closest to you.Like I said this is my 1st real smartphone. I have messed around with some of my friend's phones, everything from the original Droid to the more recent HTC Rezound and Moto Razor. So its not like I'm not familiar with the android family. This is NOT a top tier phone. It only has a single core processor and half the ram of the top smartphones. However it does come with Android 2.3.5 as standard. And when you do have ""4G"" service, the web browsing and app downloading is very quick. The camera is OK and the webcam is not that amazing but they do the job fine. Be warned though the flash is VERY bright.....its far too bright for normal use (its great using the Flashlight app though). This phone can handle all the tasks of the big boys at a fraction of the overall running costs. I would recommend an antiglare screen protector and a case for the phone though. The screen has lost of glare in sunlight and the back of the phone is very slippery. Battery life is goodd though. With moderate use I got 2 days out of it with the WiFi turned on and the screen at around 50% brightness. It can get glitchy when a bunch of the apps are running in the background but nothing a good appkiller can't fix. Overall if you want a good budget smartphone this is one of the best!PROS:Great plan prices1GHz CPU and 512MB ram very nice combo at this price pointQuick for a no-contract phoneVery nice screen (both visually and with the touch features)Not very big or heavyCan take a 32GB microSD cardCONS:Not the fastest phone in the worldCameras are not greatFlash is too brightBack is very slippery and screen is reflective without anti-glare protectorSo far...no ICS update for it without rooting","990","Samsung","8"

I do not like that the settings on the screen do not STAY lit or that it is so hard to connect toa blue tooth. The phone has applications that are not necessary that I do not use and therefore I am stuck using applications forgames that just don't go away.I find this phone to be not a worthwhile purchase since even the Techie at the Mall had to spend far too much time just trying to set up the Bluetooth and keep the screen lit. One thing I do not like is that this phone actually TOOK my husbands contacts and added him to the phone. My husband was NOT at home and 15 miles away. The contacts were freshly added one at a time and was not on my sim. I am not certain why the security of this phone is compromised. Even the Techie at the mall was shocked to learn this.

I really enjoy the resolution, good amount of pixels over a 3.7'' screen equals crisp and beautiful screen. I am a little concerned however that the memory may not be the greatest due to all the bloatware. They are putting the same amount of bloatware on this thing as they do on the Samsung Galaxy S2!! I think I might freeze the apps if I have the guts to possibly put the device in risk....Overall brilliant phone, it is good-looking and I hope that it is durable.

"7864","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","If you like the simple life stick with the flip phone. This is not a bad phone, specially considering the price, the battery life is not great but with smart phones that is a given. The multitude of functions that these phones performs is amazing, usually at a sacrifice for privacy and the more apps you download the slower the phone gets. The manual is not much help, specially if this is your first smart phone. The sound for calls is good and clear, for me that is important.I took me a month to figure out most of what the phone can do. some functions that require internet connection are done with WIFI access unless you have unlimited data from your carrier, this is true for GPS navigation, the program has to download maps as you go. Some of the better apps cost money, the free ones are basic and you have to give up privacy and see commercials.As a phone it gives you the option of storing a lot of information with your contacts, which you have the option to back up thru your carrier or g-mail. The more expensive phones can cost 5 or 6 times what this one cost, or sign a contract, which I wasn't about to do. I like the freedom of changing carrier if I'm not satisfied with the service, off course you would have to unlock your phone to use it with someone else, which I'm not sure you can do with this one. If you are thinking of that possibility get one that is unlocked. I think that if you buy a phone you should be able to do what you want with it.I give this phone 4 stars because I don't have major issues with it, but it's not perfect. The screen sensitivity is not as responsive some times and you have to press several times. The power button has to be pressed several times to be turned on or off. As far as some frivolous functions such as videos, games and music, they eat up battery, you would have to charge the phone daily, for stand by for calls it could last 2 or 3 days with out charging. I'm not sorry I bought it, I would recommend it with caution.","990","Samsung","8"

Anyway,T-mobile applies a software update pretty right awayand now both run the same version. International has faster cpu (1.5Ghz) vs T-Mobile's 1Ghz, thoughhonestly I don't feel difference. I don't run games and use the usual set of applications - Google'sGmail,Maps,Talk, Facebook's client and messenger, Skype (which is not officially supported on SamsungExhibit / Wonder but works great) and few other social networking / informational apps. T-Mobile activationwas a blaze.What I like: screen is nice except in sunny places, surprisingly clear for TFT however my eyes like AMOLEDmore. Size is great if you can live with smaller screen. CPU speed is superb for both 1Ghz and 1.5Ghz. Battery lifeis fantastic.What I don't like: TFT screen,don't see anything in particular conditions (direct sun etc).

The problem with my first phone was my fault lol my daughter had got a hold to it. My 2nd phone was doing very good at first and I was in love with this phone. It's just a smaller version of the galaxy. Pros: easy to use, front facing camera allowing video chat, small (for my hands)4g works pretty good Cons: front facing camera does not take good pics at all, comes with a bunch of apps that you probably won't use and you can't get rid of them,screen sometimes slow to respond, and you have to hold down the power button for 10-15 sec for it to come on. I initially liked the phone at 1st until I started experiencing very irritating problems. One day my phone would not charge for some reason. It decided it would start back charging a few hours later. But the most FRUSTRATING problem I have experienced is it keeps charging and discharging over and over again. It keeps blinking and vibrating non stop. The only time when it doesn't do it is when it is plugged into the charger. It may be a problem with the battery but I'm not sure but I will be replacing the battery soon. It stopped doing the charging and discharging at the moment. Also when I took the battery out and placed it back it in and then tried to turn the phone on a battery icon popped up. The phone would not turn on until I connected it to the charger. I have also read about of people having the same problem with charging and discharging problem. I will be keeping the phone for right now and see what it does when I get the new battery but I am looking for something much better! I'm not going to tell you not to buy this phone but purchase at your OWN risk. Overall o.k phone but definitely will not buy again and don't recommend.","990","Samsung","8"

It has the same speed processor, same amount of RAM, and has a newer version of Android than the old phone did... for almost 1/3 of the price! Camera isn't quite as clear, but the Sidekick's wasn't anything to brag about either, so I never used it. The battery life is impressive, no more needing to charge in the middle of the day. I can almost always go about 16 hours and still have battery life left. It has some glitches, but every Android seems to have that problem, and resetting the phone fixes the issues. Overall, very happy with the phone, and happier with it than I was with the phone it replaced!By the way, this came with a prepaid SIM card, but if you have a contract plan with T-Mobile already, you can put your existing SIM card in and use it with no problems!","990","Samsung","8"

Tethering, navigation, web browsing, maps, and something more like traffic app. Great little phone for the price. The only complain is the battery which definitely does not last long.

BUTif you activate it online.. it is there no problem!! 2) a front facing camera and 3) the fact that it has wifi and a huge android market... no wonder everyone uses their phones for everything now!! Lastly, the one peeve I have about this phone has already been covered by others; it is hard to select the little text box to text people!

No updates to the later 4.0 or later systems. Users can download to Android 4.1 but have to erase the entire memory bank to do so. T-Mobile is the bigger problem as this was an intro model giving initial 4G cell service, Thier map shows 4G in Colorado, but I don't get it everywhere, so their 4G service is skimpy in Northern Colorado, thus 4 star rating. Overall it does everything I needed with several additional apps, but their 4G service isn't the best for website browsing!

After I did they refused because they said I did not purchase it from an authorized retailer? Is that true that Amazon is not an authorized T-Mobile retailer? I paid an online company $25 for my unlock code & got it instantly. 3 days into my trip T-Mobile finally sent it to me.Every now and then the phone is slow at responding to touch but it is rare and not a problem considering the price.

Android version seems cannot be updated, so if you buy, you have to settle with it. I'm sure, since this phone is so new, its taking a little time to make a mark, but soon at such good price, it might rule the segment.This phone comes more or less a little blunt. So, be prepared with the apps to install. Very light weight, and as of now, no accesory available in the market physically... only with T Mobile shop and Amazon.The only thing I am not able to understand is, if the screen is capacitative or resistive.... at times troubles a bit...","990","Samsung","8"
"7903","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","After having the item for 4 days, I must profess myself quite satisfied so far.I am coming from US Cellular voice-only subscription and couldn't abide what they wanted to charge for data plans; I just want the ability to make occasional calls and also have moderate access to the internet while travelling, so I don't need thousands of minutes of voice plus an added $50 or something for data. This phone and $30/100 min TMobile plan seemed to fit the bill for me at the right price. I had some apprehension about whether I'd be able to utilize this plan with this phone (didn't get it at Walmart, etc.) but I had exactly zero issues signing up for this plan online. It took me about 4 mins between opening the TMobile website and having an active phone in my hand, and I have been happily surfing and downloading ever since. After reading the various reviews, my other main concern was about battery life. So far I have experienced about a 30% discharge per day with modest usage (download a few apps, some Pandora, a phone call or two, browse a few web pages), so by that measure a single charge should last me about 3 days or so. Presumably longer if it was just on standby most of the time. A friend of mine wth an iPhone says he has to recharge his about every three days so my experience seems typical, and quite satisfactory to me. I am careful to turn off the GPS and the BlueTooth unless I'm specifically using them, but otherwise I don't feel like I have to be constantly watching the battery and husbanding my usage for fear of running out. I just sequestered all the bloatware on the home pages in a folder and haven't felt the need to try rooting the thing to get rid of this stuff, as it doesn't seem to be shortening the battery life or anything.I have experienced a noticeable reduction in voice quality with this phone/plan vs. what I had with USCellular, but I don't know if it's just differences in coverage or what. The voice quality is acceptable, not great, which is why I'm not giving 5 stars. Other than that, I find this a most excellent combination of smartphone and data plan, although never having been a smartphone user before now, I may be easiliy impressed.","990","Samsung","8"
"7904","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","2","Used this phone for a couple of months. Comparing with my old Samsung SGH 900, here are my general impressions/experience1. Android 2.3 is certainly a lot more user friendly than dodgy win 6.52. The device does not have enough hardware, however. Camera resolution is too small -- making indoor pictures highly pixeled.3. Touch-responses are too sluggish. Delays are annoying. If you used any device like iProducts, the sluggish responses are unbearable.4. The phone required frequent reboots. Sometimes the phone gets persistent vibrations, and I need to open the back cover to take out the battery to reboot it.5. One time, and only one time, I left the phone unbooted for a week. I began to tell myself that the phone finally became more stable. However, the next day I received an alert from T-mobile saying the phone requires frequent rebooting to get better performance.6. RAM is not enough for this phone. RAM is always running low with ~70MB free.7. There is not word as to when OS can be upgraded to android 4.0.xIn summary, this phone is not worth the money given the sluggish/unresponsive, outdated Android OS, and frequent-rebooting user experience.I wish to have spent money on a quad-core, or at least a dual-core smartphone, which would give much better user experience.","990","Samsung","8"

Up until then we had just a plain phone no bells and whisles. When I got it. I really liked it. I went to a t mobile place and was told that the screen wasnt working right. So for $20 l got a replacement. I had the replacement a month. When It fell out of my pocket when my husband was backing the car. And when I went to look for it. it was all cracked. So that was the end of my phone. I went on craigslist and I bought a Samsung exhibt 4g the first version for $80I had that for a month and even though it was a good phone. I didnt want a used phone anymore. So I sold it for $100 on craigslist. I used that money as well as a gift cert my sister gave me for amazon to buy a new phone. The Samsung Exhibit 2 4g. I am so happy to have my phone back again. I still put the old cover on it. so now I have my new phone with the old cover.

"7908","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I am so amazed by this phone!! I seriously can't imagine someone trying this phone, looking at the price, and going on to buy some other phone that either costs 2x as much, or signing a contract!You would think they'd cheap out on this phone to make the higher price phones look better, but the only defects of this phone are expected, the basic camera (flash included) and the rear speaker (should be two front facing).Otherwise the standout feature is the crisp, beautiful screen. It is made of a very resistant material that reveals a pristine brightness. Not a single miniscule scratch after a month of use.This comes with the newest version of Android for phones, Gingerbread 2.3.5(though ICS was recently released for the flagship Samsung Galaxy Nexus).This phone becomes even better when you root it and remove some of the unnecessary T-Mobile applications, and further tweak it. There are about 5 icons that are pretty useless, but can't be removed normally. Perhaps they are included to reduce the cost.This actually works better than most GPS devices out there. Just buy a windshield or similar mount and take full advantage. This has been my experience:1. Waze - Community driven navigation that gets better when more and more people use it, reporting traffic, and new roads. This can really help you find better routes on your commute. The drawback is that it's harder find newer places in its directory.2. Google Nav - everything you can find in Google Maps, is navigable here. Complete with Google's satellite imagery. Very polished and includes traffic reports.3. TeleNav GPS - comes with the phone, and is the closest to a traditional GPS device. The free version works quite well, without ads or distractions. You must pay a monthly fee for additional features.Here is my experience with watching streaming video:1. Netflix - Works perfectly.2. Hulu Plus - Does not work yet. Says the content is not yet available for this device.3. T-Mobile TV - Included app works really well, but the best content requires subscription. Even has LiveTV!4. Amazon Video - Officially it is only for the Kindle Fire, but I got it working quite well by tricking the program. Only works on Wi-Fi.5. Crackle - The low quality you expect, but it works6. Qik - Records and uploads video instantlyGames:All Angry Bird Games work perfectly smooth, Cut The Rope a total delight, Fruit Ninja fun as always, Where's My Water is a bit tricky on this size screen, and I haven't tried much other popular games as these are enough to entertain.Reading:Kindle, Nook, Zinio, and Google Books appear nice and clear.Music:The built-in speaker is very loud, but not very clear for dynamic music. For optimal enjoyment and respect for those around you, use headphones.VOIP:Google Voice works well, and you can use it to make and receive calls (4G up to 5GB and 100min plan is perfect for $30). Google Voicemail is incompatible with prepaid plans. Skype works well and video chat is acceptable. MobileVOIP works well.So why consider a different phone? Well the processor is more than capable if you're conscious that it's a single core, and has its limits. So far, every program that I could want on a phone works well. Things start to slow down with several programs that use data service. The built-in camera won't replace your standard digital camera, but is useful for day to day capture. But why pay hundreds more for a phone that can't out do a good basic camera?Additional features: use tethering to make it work as a 4G modem to share the internet connection via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth devices, listen to internet radio, watch movie files, use as LED flashlight with a program, use as an alarm clock, view Facebook and Twitter, scan barcodes and research products, and do everything else that you can do with Android apps.Plan to keep the phone plugged in to a car charger if using for navigation, use a battery managing program, and the battery should last the day. A charger for the office (secondary location) would be advisable for heavier use, especially tethering.This phone may be unlockable by calling T-Mobile after 3 month of use, or you can pay an unlocking website to use it with another provider.","990","Samsung","8"
"7909","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","3","Purchased this phone to replace my old Samsung Behold phone. This is my first day impression:Pros: Good price for the phone. Most android phones cost over $200 and this one is below that, it came with all the Google apps you need. The 3.7"" screen is a reasonable size. One of the Samsung smartphones that actually comes with a flash and a front facing camera. SD card is located at a very convenience location. Customizable in many different ways. And Wi-fi calling is very cool.Cons: Built quality is OK. Lighter than what I expected and lacks the premium feel to it. Screen resolution is not as good as other phone but it does the job. 3MP camera is so out of date. Speakers could be a bit louder. Battery life doesn't last that long. Too much bloatwares that you don't need, and some of them don't really work (even after updates). Experience performance lag from time to time. And no additional accessories (such as SD card or earpieces) are included.","990","Samsung","8"
"7910","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","I got this phone after nearly a year of dealing with crappy handmedown phones and Tmobile being completely unsympathetic to it's contract customer. I signed a 2 year agreement and thought a great bargain on a new phone would be a part of the deal. apparently, ""they dont do that anymore."" The very best I could get was an Optimus T(?) for $150. Anything else was much more, ""discounted."" I didn't really have that money at the time, and I know a few people with the Optimus T who weren't all that happy with it. So, I figured I'd wait until the time was right.The Exhibit II is really the perfect balance between smartphone geek and budget freak. For under $200, I was expecting a lot less than this. The next lowest in price as far as a ""prepaid"" phone is the Samsung Dart. Ive seen this phone before, and even its size alone fails to thrill. But the Exhibit II has a large, brightly lit screen, and endless possibilities.Pros: Lightweight, yet doesnt have a cheap feel.Android 2.3.5 is arguably the most stable Android out there. I have a tablet that runs on 3.2, and despite it being out for a bit, still has some quirks. Most apps are hand crafted to 2.3, and it really just does everything you could possibly want. Most legit apps will run just fine, maybe some shady ones will too.Video and music Playback/streaming is great. I was surprised to get netflix up and running on my phone! No, it doesn't have beats audio or anything, but sound is good for hooking up to headphones and listening on the go.Camera/video chat-As I said, this phone isn't $400, so don't expect a Canon SLR camera here. Its, alright. It will take a good picture in good light, and a mediocre one in any other setting. But, to my surprise, the video chat is much better than expected. I could see and hear clearly, and my mom said she could see and hear me fine as well.Not sure if this is android particular, but here's a few other little cool things:The phone is basically dummy proof--for most things that even seem confusing, all the way down to the keyboard...theres a tutorial nearby.The alarm has so many things to it, such as a pre-alarm to wake you up lightly, and then the regular alarm. Snooze is adjustable, etc...simple stuff.Expandable memory--this really gives you space galore for everything!Cons:For some god awful reason there is not a camera button! you have to open the camera app, and take a picture through a button in the UI. Not a deal breaker, but just seems strange. There really is space for the button...The screen lock is a little annoying. It doesn't give you an option to take the lock off or change it, and its this annoying swipe action that for some reason gets annoying if you don't keep your phone screen on too long.I've experienced force closes. But...I can't say for sure this has to do with the phone. I have them on my tablet as well, and I even had them on my Windows computer. Maybe I just visit the wrong sites!Overall, I can say it is a great phone for someone who wants a nice, well functioning smartphone with *some* of the bells and whistles, but certainly not all of them. I guess if I could describe the Exhibit II, it would be practical. The screen is nice, the sound and video is nice, and the specs on it are on point with the medium, but not big boys. No, it doesn't have Galaxy or whatever specs...but I figure, you must REALLY be a stickler for it to pay that much more. If you aren't...this is the everyman's smart phone.*edit* 1/9/12--I will still stand at four stars...but I have encountered some other quirks. The 356mb RAM seems to be always half used despite doing absolutely nothing. I've cleared it and as many as 12 phantom applications are taking it up--plus just functioning takes up a third! Don't bost the ability to switch apps if you can only have two running without getting laggy.My theory still stands that they skimped in the ""right"" places to get the lower price. The screen is not small...but the keyboard has given me a run for my money. Its not tiny, but its that ""tenth of an inch"" missing that definitely makes it seem like my piano fingers are sausage links. Even portrait gets awkward.also, as I said about the lag...wouldn't likely be experienced with a galaxy.I haven't had major battery issues. Then again I don't browse the internet for 5 hours straight.But otherwise, if you want a fully functioning (but not perfect!) Smartphone, this is a great phone for a moderate user.9/17/12-Update. Yes, its been nearly 9 months with this phone. It updated to 2.3.6 and quickly went downhill. It would restart itself, force close, freeze, and just lag. So, I took the dive.I tediously studied for hours rooting the phone. Mine is now running on Cyanogen 9. It was not easy (apparently the simple rooting doesn't work on 2.3.6). But This phone is now amazinger (not a word) than ever. to see it running Android 4.0 really says a lot about the technical capability this phone has. Stinks on Android and samsung (bloatware) for drudging such an amazing device through the cheap mud.","990","Samsung","8"

"7921","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","T-Mobile has brought a great and powerful smartphone to the hands of no-contract customers. The Samsung Exhibit II is a fast and responsive phone with a Snapdragon processor which helps decode and watch HD videos. The phone also contains Android's Gingerbread OS which is fairly recent and can run almost all of the Apps in the Google Play Market. I purchased the phone to replace an old T-Mobile phone I bought about 4 years ago and this was my first smartphone. However, for playing games, listening to music, talking, and texting, and of course surfing the web, it is a great phone! Of course there are cons that I wish would have been addressed. The 3 mega-pixel camera is nice, but for the phone's pricetag (cheap compared to others, but still a big $200), one would wish that it could be upgraded to a 5. Also the lack of 720p video recording is a bummer, the max quality of video for the Exhibit II is 640x360. Which still isn't bad I shoot lots of video and the playback and capture is nice. Photos taken are also crisp and the colors come out well. The front facing camera is a VGA camera, meaning the camera will capture a 640x480 image (About the equivalent of a .3 Megapixel Camera) so don't expect the kind of quality of a iPhone 4S front-facing camera.Another problem that you will face rarely, but trust me, you will face it. Is the problem with the phone lagging through homescreen transitions and sometimes the phone will freeze up forcing you to reboot. After that the phone will work fine and is quickly running smoothly again. And finally the only other complaint I have had with my Exhibit II is the amount of apps that come preinstalled on the phone, also known as ""bloatware"". These apps cannot be uninstalled from the phone and take up RAM that the phone could use for other things (RAM is basically how the phone handles apps and things, the more RAM taken up, the more sluggish your phone acts). The bloatware is the only reason why the phone gets a 4/5 and not a 5 star rating.Aside from those couple of problems the phone is great. Keep this in mind that practically all phones you research and purchase will have faults and things you don't like. And this phone has very few. Thank you for reading my review and thoughts, I hope it helped in your decision!","990","Samsung","8"

Compared to the $90 with my contract phone this is great! Unfortunately, the phone is rubbish compared to my previous HTC HD7. I try and keep my patience and remind myself of the savings but popping my battery out to restart my phone because it freezes several times a day gets extremely old. I have downloaded just a few apps such as Words with Friends, Draw Something, Fruit Ninja, and a couple others. They all run fine but when I just want to put my password in to access my phone there is some serious lag. There is also a bunch of preloaded apps that I will never use that you cannot delete. For now I'll tough it out because I love dishing out at the most $40 a month compared to $90 just beware and be patient.","990","Samsung","8"
"7924","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","2","Update July 13 2012-------------------This phone has gotten buggier in the last month since I've been using it more. It is now almost to the point of being unusable. It's completely unpredictable. It's still non-stop vibrating when it shouldn't be. Other times it won't vibrate when it should - eg I'll have reception and someone will try to call or send a text and phone ""receives"" it but does nothing to notify me, it doesn't vibrate. It freezes and turns off randomly.I'm running the latest firmware. I've had all these issues since day 1. However, in the last month I've been using my phone much more often for house hunting and job hunting. As a result I've been getting way more glitches. It's absolutely frustrating me to the point of being useless. I like the theory of Android smart phone but I need more reliability. Maybe I have a bad phone, I'm not sure.Original ReviewPros:+ It's a nearly perfect compromise between a high end $400+ phone and a real chepo+ Screen is responsive and rarely ever is slow+ Mostly use it for Groove IP VoIP calls since I have only 100 voice plan minutes.Cons:- Bloatware Apps- Occasionally vibrates nonstop and requires shutdown or even removal of battery.- There are occasional seemingly unrelated glitches. For example a recent glitch involved Google Chat where the phone was displaying certain portions out of order. I would send something, my friend would respond but it would reverse the order. Vary strange - since afterwards I logged on the computer and checked that that the chat was in correct order on the computer. Glitches don't appear to have anything in common other than the underlying OS / hardware. EG, it's not always the same App that will have a glitch.- Battery life. The max I can go is 30 hrs until requiring a recharge - which is a mix of talk, App usage, and standby. Basically make sure it's charged in the morning before you leave for the day. My work building blocks the signal so it could be sucking the battery in the search for a signal it will never find.- Screen cracked - I did drop it, so it's my fault. Unfortunately it landed screen side down on rough concrete sidewalk. Touch screen still works though.Groove IP specific information:+ Sometimes it performs beautifully (exponentially better than my previous device: Samsung Galaxy Player)+ Strangely there is better quality when I call cell numbers.- Other times, there may be echos or times when the other person can't hear me. Mostly when I call wired phones.- Groove IP has many settings to tinker with. A given call may work fine, a different call may require a setting to be messed with.- When idle (eg not in a phone call), Groove IP doesn't always maintain it's connection even if it appears to be connected. I might attempt a call with nothing happening. To fix it, I quit Groove IP and enable airplane mode then put things back to normal.- Obviously if you are using someone else's WiFi such as a friend or you're works, you can't control certain settings like QoS, firewall permissions, WiFi channel, etc.Given the number of variables in internet connection quality, WiFi signal, QoS, etc - it's difficult to determine if some of these issues are indeed Groove IP problems or due to the other variables. If you want to use Groove IP, you will probably have to do some tinkering. In the Groove IP issues, I always can hear fine, but the person on the other end hears echo, or says I'm breaking up.Here's some specific examples and results with Groove IP:Call from my dad's WiFi to Verizon Landline - has trouble hearing meCall from my work WiFi to another Verizon Landline - hears echosCall from my home WiFi to Verizon Cell - works perfectCall from my work WiFi to Unknown Rebate Claim Landline Call center - says I'm breaking upCall from my work WiFi to Sprint (Vigin Mobile) Cell - works perfectCall form my home WiFi to Netflix support Landline - works perfectEcho cancellation does help when there is echo, but sometime they may not hear me. Be ready for troubleshooting.","990","Samsung","8"
"7925","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I usually stuck with the contract phones but this one made me think twice. It being a android I heard it was versatile but this thing has a lot of free apps and programs like the Google navigation(since it can be sometimes more accurate than the name brands) which is free. It also has a great camera and speaker phone and great Google voice search, battery life is about 8 hrs with some use. If you use it for like an hour then stop, you should be at 75% or 50% after an hr of use with power-save on it will stay about 85%. Even still it has a power save mode which shuts down small stuff (brightness, Bluetooth, and unused accessories apps)which extends the battery for about an hour to 30mins it depends if you have to use it or not. Cons for this phone I guess would be needs better battery life and it can lock up if you have to many apps or programs running. Even still I paid $201.99 for this phone on amazon and it would have cost me $219.99 at wal-mart. I don't know your area but in mine T-Mobile is 2nd in the area next to Verizon and i have had maybe one or twice of it going to one bar but almost all the time I have 5 bars.

A text message alert sounds like an email alert.I have a warning for you about TMobile, too. I switched from Verizon to save money, but my text messages are sometimes arriving three hours later. I had been warned about TMobile so, there you go.","990","Samsung","8"

I received this on a Friday and by Wednesday it was back in the box ready to be returned. First off, as soon as I held it in my hand I felt the lack of quality in the build. It feels very cheap and it weighs close to nothing. Immediately upon turning it on I noticed the lag on the screen. It was annoyingly slow to respond at times. I found myself having to tap the screen for any given command more than once very often. Texting was the most annoying issue on this phone. For whatever reason, the bottom most part of the screen was extremely unresponsive all the time and it just so happened to be where the window to add text was. Lastly, 4 days into owning this phone, the earpice stopped working completely. People could hear me speak but I couldn't hear anything when I held the phone to my ear. To be fair, there was one thing I liked about the phone. The screen is impressively crisp. Maybe I just got a bad unit but this phone was a complete disappointment.","990","Samsung","8"

"7935","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","2","I had the samsung exhibit II for almost a full month before giving up on it and returning it. The actual form factor is nice, very slim and compact. The buttons, particularly the on/off button are impossible to find simply by feeling around for them with your fingers, they are just too flush with the phone. The call volume, at least on my samsung exhibit II, was always extremely low. At max volume, I always strained to hear the person on the other end. Groove IP is not usable on this phone because the call quality is always echo-y, choppy, or static-y - regardless of whatever settings you tweak. Whenever I had the handset up to my face for a call, the phone functioned as though my face was pressing buttons on the phone's dial pad, so my calls were always littered with the sounds of buttons being pressed during the call. I've had better phones. I ended up replacing this phone with a Samsung Galaxy note, which is working out much, much better for me.","990","Samsung","8"

"7949","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","So far, Im really liking the Samsung Exhibit II, used on the T-Mobil ""pay as you go"" plan.. I got the phone, bought 25$ of minutes, then went in and turned off the ""use packet data"" feature, so I wouldn't incur the daily ""data"" fees normally associated with a smartphone.. Im almost always near a wifi, and use that to do all my surfing, updates and downloads.. If Im ever in a situation where I need the internet/data away from a wifi, I can quickly turn packet data on, and do what I need to do via the $1.50 unlimited data per day, that T-Mobil offers.. As for the phone itself, the only gripe I have is the battery.. Seems to only last around 8 hours before it's wanting a recharge, and I use the phone very little.. Hope to look into some apps to help that out in the near future.. The camera is also very good imo, and the led flash is also a nice perk.. Im not the most savy of smartphone users, but from my limited experience I'd recommend this phone to anyone! Especially someone like me who only uses the phone sparingly, yet wanted the technology that comes with a smartphone.

"7953","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I bought this phone for my wife for Xmas. She loves it, except for a few very annoying and very basic missing functions:When she sets up an alarm clock and shuts the phone down, the phone will not wake up or turn on at all. She has to leave the phone on at all times for the alarm clock to work. It's annoying. We like to turn our phone off at night so we don't get any phone calls. I tried all the possible options I can think of, but no luck. I'm no rookie when it comes to smart phones :) The only other work around is to switch the phone to Silent mode, then it works. But like I said, we like to turn our phones off at night. It works on any of my other phones or any phone I ever had, even a ""dumb"" phone... It's a shame that the most popular phone OS doesn't have such a very basic function. I don't get it. Also, snooze function could be better too. I have Nokia N900 with Maemo OS, and I love its snooze options, you can either touch the snooze button on the screen, or flip the phone face down if you don't feel like searching for the button when you're sleepy.What she also dislikes about this phone is that it doesn't keep notifying you that you have a text message. It only does it once, immediately when you get it. So, when you're in a noisy environment and you miss that 1st notification, you won't know you have a message until you check it yourself manually. It's very annoying to keep checking / unlocking your phone all the time, just to make sure you didn't miss an important message... A short beep or vibration would be nice. (at least, I can't find the option - anybody?)Otherwise, it's a very nice phone. I just popped my wife's old sim card in, turned the phone on and she was good to go, no issues whatsoever. Call quality is good. Battery could last longer, but that's an issue with practically all smart phones today. Oh, one more annoying thing - when it finishes charging, it beeps loudly, so it wakes you up sometimes.The camera is decent. Good enough for a phone that costs less than $200.Not much else to say, others already did. For less than $200 for a no contract phone that has all the features of a contract phone, you can't beat it. Despite the issues mentioned, she still loves it, and I would still buy it for her. I made my wife very happy.So, just like the 1st review says - Who needs an iPhone?","990","Samsung","8"

"7957","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I've had this phone for two months now and I like it a lot. Considering the price, this is one of the best deals out there. That is what warrants the 5 stars I am giving it. However, in an absolute sense it is not as good as some of the other phones out there. So I will focus on some things that are not so good. This is not to put the phone down, because obviously I am giving it 5 stars when considering the ""bang for your buck"" factor. It is to give a more realistic assessment of the performance regardless of the price.The main issue is that the phone can get quite laggy. Switching screens can take up to a few seconds sometimes. I have tried different launchers besides the Samsung one and they all have this issue. I often manually clear the memory, and this seems to help. However, often I actually have to restart the phone. Note that these issues can arise even when I am using just standard applications like messaging and the contact list. This does not seem to be an issue with the higher end phones, for instance my brother's Galaxy SII.The battery life is not very good. I have to charge at least once per day, most of the times even more frequently. Some of the more advanced features are particularly battery draining. This includes GPS, Wifi, and video calling (using skype). Especially GPS takes a lot of energy and the phone gets very hot after some time. I definitely recommend buying a car charger if you will be using this feature frequently and make sure to turn off GPS when you are done.The wifi connection gets dropped periodically. I used my laptop on the same network and have no problems, so I believe that it is a problem with the phone and not the network. It usually reconnect right away so it is not such a big issue. However, if you are wifi calling (as I have to do since my office gets bad reception), your call will be dropped.The bloatware is annoying. However, I was able to root the phone and remove unwanted programs without any major issues using just basic computer skills. A good thing about this phone is that even though rooting technically voids the warranty, it is cheap enough to take that risk.The power button is right across the volume buttons. When I touch the power button (which is often since it unsleeps the phone), there is a good chance that I will also inadvertently press the volume button. Not a huge issue, but a little annoying.But all in all, I am very happy and glad that I saved a lot of money for a decent phone without contract.Edit:Another minor issue is that certain portions at the fringes of the screen are not so sensitive to the touch. For texting, sometimes I have to press the screen several times to get the keyboard to come up. Again, not a major problem but it can get annoying. Especially when I am trying to text and drive...just kidding.","990","Samsung","8"

Decent set of features, great screen resolution (screen size is also just right - the phone in not huge that it does not fit anywhere and not tiny like my old myTouch 3G or Dart). Battery life is very good for a 4G phone (maybe because it's not LTE). Using it with my old t-mobile family value plan - just put my own SIM in there and it was ready to go. We did have to get TPU cases for them since the phone is kind of slippery as others say. The cases though fit well and make the phones look more expensive than they are.

"7962","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","Update after 1 year of owning:I now hate this thing. It is ridiculously underpowered and takes FOREVER to do the simplest tasks. Even answering a call can be frustrating! The touchscreen is SLOW to react nearly every time I need to use it. The only thing keeping me from tossing it out the window when it upsets me is that I have a 32gb sd card in the thing that I would like to keep. I think it ran half decent before the android system updated to the latest version. Ever since then things got REALLY slow. Kind of like running windows 7 on a 486 processor or something. It's reallly, really, REALLY slow. I had to turn of the security swipe feature because the thing lags so much that you cant complete the swipe properly. I hardly have any apps installed on this thing and it still crawls along at a snails pace. Even swiping from page to page of your homescreen is an exercise in frustration. The icons have to ""load up"" every single time you page. It's just awful. Really. I have a Galaxy 2 sitting here on my desk still in the box waiting for me to open it. I can't wait to be rid of this garbage.Old Review from 01/2012 followsComing from Apple, getting used to the Android system took a few days. Everything is kinda all over the place and the 40 or so unnecessary installed apps that come with the phone make it even more confusing for a first timer. (most of those apps are dumb and should be removed to free up memory) If you are used to the simplistic and organized way Iphone works with Itunes, this is a bit challenging at first. There is nothing clearly pointing out WHY you had to create a google account upon booting up the phone for the first time. (you are essentially creating your Android log in and password) There is no onscreen guide explaining Android Market and how this is your key to apps, games, music, video, etc.Eventually you figure it out, and once you do you start learning that there is far more integration and customization possibilities with the Android system over Itunes. Not knocking Itunes, I still use my Ipod Touch everyday and there is much comfort when I go back to that interface. It's just cleaner and more inviting.The phone is very capable and gets a great 4G signal all around my area. The phone has a wi-fi calling capability that automatically turns on when you are in a known wifi hotspot. My home network is on a powerful Cisco Dual-band router set up as two separate channels(2.4 ghz G and 5 ghz N). Even with a very strong signal strength, the call quality is bad over my wifi. People tell me my voice breaks up. I have since switched off wi-fi calling and it's much better. It must be also noted here that the phone does not find wifi N signals in the 5 ghz range even though the phone is wifi N capable. I have learned that this is common. Apparently there are many devices out there that claim to be wireless N devices but only operate at the 2.4ghz range. Kinda dumb since if you have a wifi N router, you are encouraged to set it up at 5ghz. My Xbox finds 5ghz and connects great, but my Playstation 3 cant find the signal so I have to use G. Same with this phone.The phone runs pretty good most of the time, but it has moments of lag, where it seems to be thinking. Usually this is right after closing an app or entering the home screen from the lock screen. Apps seem to run smoothly and the phone apparently runs 3d game apps better than many more expensive phones according to a benchmark article I read.The screen is a nice size, about .25"" larger than my 3G Ipod Touch. It's also very crisp and clear. The touch sensitivity seems very accurate, on par with the Iphone, but it just doesn't feel as nice on your fingers as the nice Iphone glass screen.Now to the biggest problem with this phone... the battery. This phone literally takes over 3 hours to charge from about 15% capacity with the power off. With the power on it takes over 4 hours. After charging to 100% you get about 3 hours of heavy use out of it tops. If you do some texting, take a couple calls, play a few games and check your email I guarantee the battery dips below 50%. So for a 4hr standby charge you get about 3 hours of heavy use. (with the GPS on you will be lucky to get 2 hours) That is just terrible. I don't get it. Lithium Ion batteries are known to charge quickly and give long usage. This phone's battery is quite the opposite. It is equally slow at recharging on an ac charger or a car charger. Maybe the charger itself is terrible? If it charged faster I wouldn't be so miffed about the short usage time. But this phone spends more time on the charger than it does in my pocket.My Ipod Touch (Lithium Ion Battery)can recharge fully in about 30 minutes from a completely depleted state. From a full charge I can use it heavily for 5-6 hours before I even get a low battery warning. Much better usage to recharge ratio.Fortunately there are other (upgrade) lithium Ion batteries available for this phone but they are expensive. ($40-$50) I have not tried one yet but I probably will. I will update my review at that time and let you know how well that works.So, the phone gets 4 stars, because its a great phone for the money. But the battery is terrible. Just so you know.","990","Samsung","8"
"7963","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","Started with a straight talk phone that advertised nation wide calling. Well if you dont live in a big city you will have no servie at all as i found out. After researching what little info there was, i discovered they use sprint towers BUT only certain types of them not all of sprints! Got a refund on their phone but wasted $45 on their card. The search was on for a android phone that would work everywhere.The T-mobile deal was to good to be true $30 for unlimited text and internet service and 100 minutes of talk time. Now heres the killer deal, it has something called wifi calling. Go almost anywhere nowdays and you will find public internet. Just connect to it and make FREE calls that do NOT count off your 100 minute talk time.TIP: Get a $30 card before you activate phone and do it through the phone. If you call customer service for activation they will tell you you can only do the unlimited everything $50 plan. Also if you ever upgrade to the higher plan, you can not go back to the $30. I would try the $30 and use the wifi calling as much as possible for a month or 2 and see if it will work for you.It looks like i will use less than 30minutes of talk time per month so far. You can not beat this deal anywhere. The phone has everything the pricer androids have and it has as good coverage as anyone elses plan has in my area (rural NC) so far very happy with phone and service!","990","Samsung","8"
"7964","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I got this phone for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! It is her first smart phone. She never wanted one because she hates the size of the phones. She thinks all the new phones look way too ""manly"" because the screens are so big. She has had an iPod Touch and loves that. This phone is the only modern smart phone that has about the same screen size as the iPod Touch.It runs perfectly well. It is smooth and can run about any game I could find on the market. The only problem I have found is that it doesn't have a huge backing from the xda devs. There isn't an easy root as far as I can find. There aren't any custom roms either. Other than that I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking for a smaller smart phone with good specs. Plus it is cheap!","990","Samsung","8"
"7965","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","Pros: non-contract, great performance for price, good size, light weight, front+rear camera, LED flash, EASY TO ROOTCons: loaded with bloat software from T-Mobile, back is slippery, power button is hard to find and press, custom ROMs are not fully developed (as of Jan 2012, see update)As far as non-contract phones go, this phone has the most power per dollar of any Android phone I've seen. After rooting and removing bloat, it's pretty snappy, but I do experience some lag at times, especially when unlocking the screen. Other than that, it's everything I wanted in a non-contract Android phone for a great price.UPDATE after 6 months: Still a great phone. Custom ROM development has come a long way, as other reviews have mentioned. With a custom ROM it's even faster, but it still lags when unlocking, about a full second from the time you press 'power' to the time the screen lights up, but once it lights up, it's good to go. A basic case solved the problem of the slippery back. I also got an unlock code from T-Mobile, and it's working fine in the country I'm living in now.","990","Samsung","8"
"7966","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","UPDATE AFTER 5 DAYS. I have to update my rating of this phone to 5 stars. While it is not a cutting edge $600 (unsubsidized) phone, it is a great phone. Yes, there is some bloatware on it and I really like a larger screen, but it is a solid phone with much to commend it. This is a great little phone. Worthy of 5 stars, even if there are a few annoyances. Considering the price, and the great promo plan price through T-Mobile (5GB Data, Unlimited Text, and 100 minutes talk is the one I use). More on that below.I say ""little"" because, for me, it is little. I used to have the HTC EVO with the 4.3 screen. I was considering going to a Razr with that 4.6 screen... but went with this because I already have a 7 inch tablet... I really don't need a phone almost as big. Still, this has a larger screen than an iPhone. And it is quite capable as an Android phone.Others have excellent reviews of this phone, so I will look at the plan itself:*************************************************************5GB of DATA and Unlimited Text and 100 Minutes of Talk for Thirty Dollars????Since the online world is a buzz about THIS PHONE and specifically about the T-Mobile's 4GMonthly Plan, let me share my experience with getting on this plan when buying through Amazon:First of all, the date is 1-8-2012 and there is a rather extraordinary cell phone plan being offered by T-Mobile and Wally World...buy one of 2 or 3 data smart phones (such as this one) and get a $30 monthly (no contract) plan that includes 5GB internet data (a whole lot, you won't likely run out)at 4G speed, unlimited data at slower speeds after that (if you do run out), unlimited text messaging and video messaging, and 100 minutes of talk time... all for $30 a month. Now, understand, that low talk time is a killer for many users... some are using an application to talk via the data plan for some of their calling to help that. But if you go over the limit, it is only ten cent a minute after that. There you have it; that is the special Wally and TMobile offer as of now. Many of the Wally Mart stores are sold out of these phones and plans for the clamor for it. But the online community *(and TMobile) was unsure if purchasing this phone from other places would allow someone to get this same deal (instead of exclusively from Wally World). It is to this issue which I now write... if uninterested, skip to the end of review. ***Even though I called before hand to T-mobile to make sure I could get this ""Wally Plan"" (5GB/$30), upon trying to go online and activate I found out that the phones purchased from Amazon did not qualify. Through very many call backs, I eventually succeeded in getting this plan. However, I discovered afterwards that I didn't need to go through this time and effort. Rather, if you buy the phone from a place different from Wally World or T-mobile, you can simply call T-Mobile and order a $7 SIM card from them...then you will qualify for this special plan. Obviously, verify this for yourself first.Of course, you may not even want this plan. Therefore, judge for yourself what plan you need. The phone (if you understand what you are getting), is a great phone!Gingerbread Android, 3.7"" sharp, clear, multitouch screen, Android App Store, T-Mobile extras, MicoSD card slot, Bluetooth 3.0, 1 GHz processor, Wi-Fi networking plus Wi-Fi Calling capabilities, 3 MP camera/camcorder; video chats via front camera; Bluetooth stereo music; microSD expansion; HTML web browser with Flash 10.1; Charger and Data Cable, Cases available starting at 1Cents on Amazon, High Def 720, Better audio than my EVO, and on and on. Now, if you try to compare this (now) midlin' list of attributes to the Motorola Razr or the Galaxy Nexus, well, you are going to dislike this phone. But, this phone will satisfy those who understand what they are getting... in fact, they may jump for joy that they have a non-contract phone of this quality.***I am thrilled that I have a very nice (even though I would prefer larger screen and an LTE network to run it on) phone and a great ""4G-ish"" data plan at such a price. This phone is very light and the smaller form factor makes it very portable.I have not tried the GrooveIP app yet (to go along with GoogleVoice (aimed at increasing talk minutes by using VOIP calling), I will update if I find a good alternative. So you know, the Wifi calling feature that comes on the phone works, but also uses your minutes. Just installing Google Voice will use your talk minutes too. Not sure why that is, yet...but will update if I find a workable combination.Good phone made great by virtue of the price/performance metric!And hey! I don't have a contract!!!! :) A great deal indeed!","990","Samsung","8"
"7967","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","The Exhibit II is a pretty good phone. The picture quality is impressive and I haven't had any big problems with it yet. Here are the issues I've found:- The buttons on the lower 0.5"" of the touchscreen are often unresponsive to normal touch - I have to press and hold the button until it detects my finger.- I received a call one time where the phone only vibrated, although the phone was not in silent mode and the ringer volume was about 75%- The phone is pretty sluggish when ""waking up"" (but then again, aren't we all?)- GPS only works with internet connection (Wi-Fi or 4G, which is probably standard), although the phone settings are set to use only GPS satalites because I don't have data on my planThere are a few issues with the phone, but overall I'm pleased with the purchase.","990","Samsung","8"

Imagine how irritated you'll get when you wanna call someone right away, and realize that ur phone has already freezed.. I'm a regular costumer of amazon.

"7976","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I've used various Blackberries for the last 8+ years. Most recently I used the Blackberry Bold (top of the line). I was getting frustrated with it because it would freeze up and I would have to restart it frequently. When I tried to go to websites, it would just shut down because the pages were too big.My husband switched first. His old BB Bold wasn't compatible with his work email. He got this phone and loved it! Finally I tried it. It was fast and user-friendly. (Both qualities are lacking in the BB). Plus, the Samsung had so many apps!I had to switch-- I really didn't even have a choice. Blackberry is almost obsolete and this phone had so many features that made the phone easy to use and FUN to use. It doesn't freeze up. It downloads web pages with ease. The keyboard and touch screen are easy to use. If I could give it 6 stars I would!","990","Samsung","8"
"7977","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","The Plan - $30 / month, 5gb 4G data, unlimited EVDO, 100 minutes. EXCELLENT coverage in my area. Previously had Verizon and Virgin Mobile, T-mobile fits somewhere in between the 2, not as good as Verizon, much better than Virgin Mobile. the 4G is about as fast as my 6mbps ATT DSL at home, PERFECT for pandora, netflix, tethering (included btw).The Phone - cheap back, everything else is about as good as the Droid Incredible that came out over 2 years ago.This is hands down, THE best prepaid plan and phone you can get right now.","990","Samsung","8"

"7979","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","2","Highly disappointed that the phone does not support voice commands for hands free calling from a headset. Ditto for not having a built-in radio but I should have noticed that. Also, there is no bluetooth driver for this phone meaning I can't sync it with Windows Media Player running under Windows 7 without connecting it via USB. Fortunately, I finally figured out the phone will be consistently recognized by my system if I connect the USB cable to the phone before connecting it to the computer but I would still rather save the wear and tear on my USB ports as well as my time by connecting automatically with bluetooth. Most of all, I should have bought this from another seller that offers a $30 refill card with unlimited Web and text but only for phones purchased from them; why can't Amazon offer the same deal? I wish I had saved a hundred dollars and bought a pre-paid smartphone from a T-Mobile competitor and it is highly unlikely I will be buying another T-Mobile or Samsung product.","990","Samsung","8"
"7980","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","I ABSOLUTELY love this cell. In fact, I'm using it to write this review. I have the Walmart plan( 30$ a month for 5gb data, unlimited texting, 100 mins) and I'm super happy with it! The 5gb data means I can use 170 MB a day! Perfect flexible for Pandora!.However,the battery SUCKS unless you route it and uninstall the bloatware. Hate the keyboard so I downloaded GO keyboard from the market. Love it. Except the battery.","990","Samsung","8"
"7981","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","3","When the phone is fully functioning, its a excellent piece of hardware. Sure it could be better, but for around $200, its worth it.Now the catch is the 'when it is working correctly'. The phone has the ability to use VOIP for calling when in a Wifi zone (which makes up for T-mobile's bad coverage). The catch is when you try to switch back to the cell network. Its a hit and miss on a good day. 9 out of 10 times, you have to restart the phone to get the connections to reset. This to me is a basic flaw in the phone. Worst is lets say when you had to rush out from home where it was on WiFi, and then as you get somewhere, you need the cell ON, but of course you now have to restart it and wait to make that emergency call at the airport or somewhere like that! Thats just bad design.","990","Samsung","8"
"7982","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","2","This is a very nice no-contract phone. I'm sure it doesn't compare to those dual-core latest/greatest android phones, but its a good price for a decent phone. A couple of things I wanted to highlight. First of all, there is a big discussion about whether or not you can activate the $30 plan [100 minutes, 5GB of 4G data] susposedly exclusive to walmart when you buy the phone from here. Now, I can't say that you can do it in all circumstances, but let me just say that it is possible since I was able to do this. All I did was follow the tmobile online activation. I didn't call anyone (I don't think you can do it if you call, unless you pester them into doing it for you). I also activated a temporary number, but plan to transfer my virgin mobile number later. You don't need to buy an activation kit from tmobile.com, you can use the one that came with the phone.*PROS*-Display Screen is very nice. Coming from a 3.2 inch Optimus V.-Phone is fast (1 Ghz). You won't see much lag if any.-Wifi speed is fast. (I compared it to other phones and this one consistenly is faster)-Size is perfect for pocket. (Same size as Optimus V but thinner with larger screen)-Front facing camera for chat. (Works with Skype/google voice)*CONS*-No zoom on the back camera-pictures are a bit grainy with the back camera. (3.2 Megapixels - a bit disappointing)-4G connection is slow. The best I've seen is 800 mbps download. I was getting much better on 3G from Virgin Mobile.-Takes forever to charge. I think 4+ hours from 0% to 100%Updated 04/02/12:The screen brightness on this phone outdoor is horrible. It is worse than my Optimus V. At lowest brightness setting, I can't see anything outdoor and can't enter my screen lock code. This was not a problem on the Optimus V. At the brightest setting, I can barely make things out. The Optimus V screen is brighter than this one. The could be a deal breaker for me so might have to return the phone. No argument about the display indoor...it looks really nice. I've got to move it from 4 stars to 2.","990","Samsung","8"
"7983","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","3","I got this phone a few months ago because I've started using Google Docs and the screen on my previous phone (comet) was too small to use it comfortably. I'm happy with the screen on the phone. It's fast enough to play some games. Angry Birds is laggy on most levels, but playable. I have the Kindle app and find it's comfortable to read on as well if I don't have my Kindle on me.Things I don't like about the phone:1. There is NO alert/notification LED. This is the biggest deficiency. Have to activate the screen to see if I have any notifications.2. There is no auto-adjust option for screen brightness.3. The phone beeps (or vibrates when on vibrate) when it's fully charged. Who ever thought it would be a good idea to have your phone wake you up in the middle of the night when it's charged??4. Phone has a lot of bloat ware. I really need to get around to rooting and deleting the stuff that's not needed.5. A minor annoyance, but it's difficult to tell which end of the phone is which by feel and the volume button is on the opposite side as the power button so I find myself often pressing the volume by mistake when I want to hit the power button.6. I wasn't able to get tethering to work. Not sure if it's my plan or something else, but can tether on my old phone with the same SIM card.7. No Ice Cream SandwichThings I like about the phone:1. Memory is more than adequate for my needs. I'll need to add a microSD card eventually, but haven't needed to yet.2. Screen size and quality3. It's adequately fast4. It's cheap5. Camera has a flash6. 4g (HSPA+)I'm still happy I got this phone, since I'm rather frugal and I wouldn't want to spend twice as much money to get a phone that only takes care of a few more of my disappointments.","990","Samsung","8"

"8022","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","2","I bought this to replace my G-2 as it was going to cost too much and take too long to get my busted screen fixed. On paper this Samsung was almost identical to my G-2. In practice, this Samsung isn't fit to wipe the G-2's proverbial butt. NO comparison, the G-2 is a worlds better device in every way. This has to be the most ""glitchy"" device I have ever had the displeasure of owning. I am not a Samsung fanboy and this phone provides more reasons as to why I continue to dislike the over-rated Samsung empire of mobile phones. I am constantly drawn back to them by the overwhelming masses that love their brand as well as the media coverage. And true to form, I am constantly disappointed time and time again. Buy this if you have no other choice in my Opinion. The HTC and LG phones have proved to be far more polished than the last 4 Samsung phones I have owned. Just in case someone might be wondering, T-Mobile prepaid phones are no different than their standard phones unlike AT&T and Sprints' prepaid phones.","990","Samsung","8"

"8024","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","3","I purchased this because I wanted a decent smartphone without the exorbitant prices for monthly service for contract phones. That's exactly what I got. I don't talk much on the phone, and since I'm ancient, don't text:-) I really only have three complaints about this phone, which is otherwise worth every penny.The 1st complaint is that it has the older Android 2.3 OS. I have tablets with 4.0 and 4.1 and had a 3.2 before it was upgraded. There is NO comparison between these more advanced OS's and the one on this phone. I don't really mind it, but it's not nearly as useable.The 2nd complaint is the enormous amount of non-removable (without rooting) bloatware. A few of those apps are OK, but, serioiusly T-Mobile and Samsung, that's the most bloat junk I've ever seen, and I have a LOT of devices (addicted).The 3rd and most important negative is that the volume control is directly opposite the on/off button--side to side--so it's easy to turn your volume waaaay down or completely off while turning the phone on OR off. This bit me hard one day when I never heard a medical emergency phone call from my wife. This last problem is critical, but can be worked around by just paying attention to the problem.I'm not sorry I bought this phone. It is my first smartphone and without paying a lot for the phone or being tied into a contract, I now understand why folks are so crazy about them. The contract I chose is month to month and gives me all the calling and texting I'll ever need, as well as 5GB of data, which is fantastic for the price.Will I keep it? Heck, no. As soon as the new phone tsunami comes this fall and before Christmas, I will be buying the best one I can find. My wife will love this phone:-)The buying experience from Amazon was excellent, as usual...and no, I don't work for them.","990","Samsung","8"

Now I've had it for a few months sometimes it doesn't it doesn't have the fastest response speed but it still gets the job done just fine. $200 seems like a lot of money but that's not bad for paying full price compared to other smartphones that are lots more.

I felt like I had a legacy android phone. When you have to reboot your phone 4 times a day to keep it running, you know something is wrong. Then came the revelation: I wiped the phone of its OS/Rom and installed a custom ROM/OS. I put CM9/Android 4.0 on the phone. Guess what? Everything runs phenomenal! My wife has a Samsung Galaxy S2 and my phone now runs immensely faster than hers. I never experience lag or freezes, the GPS works flawless and fast. Honestly, I switch between 10 different apps in a matter of minutes and the phone never slows down. It runs extremely fast! I love it so much and it has now become my favorite phone.

The android phone and our android tablet sync as she switched from one to another to read. She also emails and texts and phones. We both use T-mobile pre-paid and mostly our home wi-fi to keep cost of data down. she has used about $100 in 10 months of ownership, I use about $100 in 3 months by buying 1 days worth of data as I need to travel to non-wi-fi areas or anticipate more than 20 minutes in a day of phone calls.","990","Samsung","8"

"8057","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","Postscript 12/16/2013: I've now dedicated this handset to car use - both in terms of OBDII monitoring and motion video recording. Additionally, when not in monitoring use, for vehicle location, something Android/Google lets you do. Completely brilliant, it's sat in the frozen SUV, well shielded, without freezing or dying, reporting its location back to Google. This is, admittedly, a specialized non-phone application, but considering the capabilities and the price it is very well suited for that. Love it. I mean, you don't want to take a $500 phone and use it for tinkering, if you're not independently wealthy, but this, I can manage, the ancillary mobile charge is only $10/month.Postscript 9/26/2013: This device/version of Android works brilliantly with the Paypal Here device and application - I understand not all Galaxy's do. The only caveat is that you need to set up the Paypal app with a mobile #/PIN login - a regular login crashes the app. The new version of the Android Device Manager, accessible at the Google site, which can locate, lock or wipe the phone remotely, works with this handset too. GPS works fine, so does Bluetooth, WiFi calling (UMA) works, and I am impressed with the battery life - my Blackberry Torch 9810 doesn't last a full day on 4G, the Exhibit 4G does. All in al, the T679 provides a very stable, manageable, and capable little handset, for relatively little money.Original review 9/21/2013: What with 672 reviews of this unit, you probably don't really need mine, so let me just add why I purchased it, and what I found. I- wanted to get a sufficiently advanced Android device so I could try Paypal's ""Here"" credit card device;- wanted to learn a bit of Android, having been a Blackberry / Nokia aficionado until now; and- wanted a device I could use with one of my existing postpaid T-Mobile lines.It does all that, admirably. I'll add a postscript as soon as I've had a chance to test the Paypal device, but for now, I was able to pop in one of my SIM cards, and have the thing come up on TMO's 4G (HSPA+) and use its UMA (WiFi Calling). IOW, all good, there aren't any restrictions on the device as far as I can see, it'll use 4G data too, although I have that turned off on this line for now.The Android thing was just to satisfy my curiousity, what can I tell you, it works, I can't quite fathom all of the excitement, other than that you get a gazillion apps, which for those with the time to play must be a Godsend. I like the support I get from Google, including Google Maps with offline capability, and Google Voice, something I've been using for a long time. Am I happy telling Google where I go, what I do, who I do it with, and when? No, so this handset will never be my primary handset, but if that doesn't bother you, this is a very cheap - although as I write this it's gone up a bit from what I paid - powerful, and very convenient, pretty little handset. I do realize it is fashionable to carry a flat screen TV in your shirt pocket these days, but for those not bothered, and for those who already have a tablet and a laptop, this is a nice device. I especially like the lack of buttons on the surround - on my Blackberry and my Nokia, I am forever pushing things I shouldn't. Importantly, this is a brand spanking new, T-Mobile branded, device, with the factory seals intact, and updated to the latest (2.3.6 T679UVLK2) Android version available for it, at a very decent price - mine came from shopcelldeals, can't vouch for other vendors. TMO will even unlock it for you, if you're an existing customer and you meet the requirements, and they provide the warranty and support for it.Enjoy.","990","Samsung","8"
"8058","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","While the phone does take pretty decent pictures, and even has a decent amount of memory meant to deal with applications, it falls short where it matters. This is the first phone I've ever had that just shuts down by itself for no apparent reason. As it can do this twenty times a day, and without any indication of it having done so as long as it's in my pocket, things can be very frustrating. I bought this one quickly as a replacement for an LG that decided to go for a swim. While the price for an immediate replacement was right with the Exhibit, I wish I would have waited. The issue with it shutting down is not isolated to myself either. Just do a Google search and you will see that this is a very common problem. Stay away from this one if you value your peace (i.e. lack of frustration). Also, while the memory is technically there to handle applications, it doesn't seem to actually work.

We have received your SIM Unlock Request. Unfortunately, we are unable to process your request at this time. The account must meet the following criteria:1. Subscriber has been active for 40 days since the device was first used on the line2. Must have $50.01 or more in accumulative refills since activation3. Must have device usage within the last 7 days by the mobile number requesting the unlock codePlease submit a new SIM Unlock Request once the subscriber has met the Eligibility criteria.I felt that customer care based in Philippines appears to be interested in finding the reason why they cannot help. It appears that they just read the script. They are good with FAQ.I think when it is pre paid phone and customer has paid full price of phone, it is right of customer to have unlock phone.

It will test your patience on numerous occasions. For one, the memory is terrible. After about eight months into the phone, I have no memory what so ever to listen to music & take photos/look through photos. It glitches a lot. With incoming phone calls the screen will be black for a few seconds THEN will show the call screen, whereas on better smart phones the call will automatically show up. Loading applications takes a little longer than desired. I've tried applications in which that would help speed up the phone, but there's only so much you can do. Sometimes, if the phone is overwhelmed by so much, it just reboots itself. The battery, over time, will go on you, especially if you use a lot of applications. I would suggest to constantly have a charger handy. I mean, for a person that needs a phone with basic smart phone capabilities for cheap, this is okay. However, I have learned my lesson not to be cheap with my cell phones. I'll be sure to save up & look at higher end models for now on. Good luck with this phone.","990","Samsung","8"

"8070","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","2","FYI: I have had this phone for less than 1 week.I havent been totally displeased with this phone (but I cant bring myself to give it 3 stars). It is quick, the screen has pretty crisp images/good resolution and colors (depending on what you are used to), the camera is good (not great), and the Samsung interface is better than vanilla Android in my opinion (adding shortcuts/widgets to the homescreen for example). However, this phone has been freezing a LOT (also..the pull down notification bar often wont stick/stay down, it just goes back up, the call volume could be a little louder, and the signal ability seems slightly weaker than other phones). Basically, it freezes once or twice with every 20 minutes (straight) of use. And it was like that even when I barely had any apps downloaded onto it. To make matters worse, it doesnt just pick up where it left off after a few minutes of me waiting...it concludes by restarting itself! This is usually not a big deal but I have worked on school papers via phone before and I would hate for it to shut down during a time like that. Such an issue just doesnt make the phone feel dependable. Im considering returning this phone.If it matters to you...the freeze ups are not during gaming or watching movies...they are during simpler things like clicking on something (or just the Back button) within the first 1 or 2 screens of an app. Neither Home nor Back work. Not even volume (oh, that freezes up too by the way...when there is no other freezing going on.) The only button that works is the lock screen/power button but it only provides the on/off screen, not any actual locking or powering down during the freeze.Tiny gripe: I wish there was some other way to turnt he screen on other than just by the somewhat stiff, high-up button on the right-hand side. Its not a convenient spare fo the moment location. The phone is a *little* awkward to hold/not narrow enough and I dont have short fingers. The plus of the power/lock button being high is carefree placement in a car mount, but its just high up enough to not be a comfy location. The volume button is a little lower and no problem.Tethering - at least as is - does not work, but I dont fault the phone for that (but I wanted to let you know what to expect). I am quite sure it is due to T-Mobile now charging (monthly add-on) for Wifi and USB tethering. I havent had any problems with bluetooth connectivity.","990","Samsung","8"

Both my husband and I purchased this phone a few months ago. Both of them are junk. My phones vibrates twice a day forcing a reboot to resolve. My husband's vibrates twice a week. Both phones brightness just magically get turned down on the lowest settings in the middle of using them forcing you to go into settings and adjust. Some keys on phone require you to tap three or four times to get a response... If you want a paperweight or a vibrator - LOL, then this phone is for you.","990","Samsung","8"

"8075","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","The phone is really good for the price point. However there are three things that are annoying with the phone that other people do not comment on. One is that the text messaging does not work that comes with the phone and you have to download a separate app to make it work properly. The other annoyance is that the phone freezes and resets once in a while. I've read that you can root the phone and after uninstalling the T-Mobile apps the second problem will go away. Lastly 512mb isnt that much memory and unless you know how to clean the memory it may run slow.That said the phone is really great. It is small. I've clocked downloads on T-Mobile as fast as 6-8 megabits per second (depends on where you live). Very customizable and functional. Knowing what I do know now, I would still get the phone as it does get the job done once you download the right apps.I'm sure other apps can solve the problems. These are the ones that I use: go sms pro, Advanced task killer and start up cleaner.","990","Samsung","8"

"8078","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","3","This is one of the best budget smart phones I could find for T-mobile currently. I have a 2 year contract with T-mobile and it is not prepaid. I had bought a used HTC G2, but it bricked after 1 year of use. Since I purchased the HTC G2 used and it wasn't covered with warranty I was left to find a smart phone to use. When I went to a T-mobile store, buying a smart phone from the kiosk would cost 350 and up. The current flagship smartphone for T-Mobile is the HTC One S and has a list price of 599. Even with the offer to split the payment over several months, the idea of spending that much for a smart phone that would be obsolete in a few years bothered me. At almost half the price of what was being offered at T-mobile's kiosk, I found this phone.I quickly discovered there are many bargain android smart phones that are unlocked (can be used on multiple carriers). If you are in the market to purchase a phone and already have a plan, be sure to check that the bandwidth frequencies are compatible. Some of the 3g and 4g phones will work fine with AT&T and not with T-Mobile (only EDGE). I found while searching the budget android phones, screen size varies greatly. Some of the cheaper phones around 100 seemed to have a smaller screen. Given it is the primary input, I knew that typing text messages and emails on a tiny screen would be irritating unless it had a physical keyboard or large enough screen.The Samsung Exhibit II is now a little dated, but comes with Gingerbread and a bunch of unnecessary apps that cannot be uninstalled unless you root the phone. Rooting the phone voids the warranty and is the only reason why I have not done so already. The response to input on the phone is fairly snappy and runs smoothly even though the RAM is a little small. The screen quality is surprisingly good and sharp. Call quality is decent. I was even able to make a video call with the phone and had no issue with it. The battery life with this phone has been typical of android phones that I have used, lasting about a day with moderate use before needing to be recharged. T-mobile's 4g network is very fast where I live, but is throttled after a certain amount of data has been used. At this price range, I think it is an excellent value.The reason I have given this product an only average rating is that text messaging would not work for a week. I went through all the typical troubleshooting methods and reset to factory default twice, contacted Samsung and T-mobile customer support to get text messages to send. Samsung was very unhelpful and stated that issues with text messaging are an issue with the phone service provider. T-mobile initially stated that it was Samsung's fault for not updating the drivers. When going through the T-mobile's forums, it became clear that I am not the only one with this issue. For a while the only way to send text messages was to disable the 4g and switch to EDGE. This bothered me a lot as it became very annoying to switch every time I wanted to send a text message. I was originally going to return this phone, but decided to call T-mobile one more time. The tech at T-mobile was able to fix the issue and stated that there was an error on their end and I am now able to send text messages. I've now had this phone for over a month and have not had any other issues.On a related note, the customer service at Amazon was stellar. I had called them stating my frustration with the product and how it was not operating as advertised. The CSR was very friendly and answered all my questions regarding Amazon's return policy. I am continually impressed by the competitive prices and customer service from Amazon.","990","Samsung","8"
"8079","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","When I tried to activate the phone online, the phone serial # (IMEI) was not recognized. I called customer service and an hour later the phone was activated. However, since I wanted to port my number from Virgin, I had to wait an additional 32 hours before that occurred. I realize that was probably due to Virgin, not T-Mobile, but still a hassle. In the meantime they gave me a temporary number to use.Now on to the phone itself. Tried to set up the WiFi calling to no avail even though I had an excellent signal from my router. The phone hooked up to my WiFi instantly with no issues, but the WiFi calling feature would not work. Tried to make calls on the network, and that didn't work either. Finally called support and after almost 2 hours of jumping through hoops, the rep tells me that the phone is probably defective. For T-mobile to make an exchange, it could take up to 2 weeks, so the rep suggested that I contact Amazon for a replacement, which I am now waiting for.I don't have a good feeling about this and I fully expect the replacement phone not to work either. I'm guessing that all of the Amazon stock on these phones probably were built at the same time. I will update my review after getting the replacement.","990","Samsung","8"

I chatted with a TMo CSR this morning and they confirmed that the phone will work for voice calls but the PAYG plan does not permit data at all. This suits me perfectly since I plan to use WiFi exclusively.About unlocking the handset, the CSR said that since I bough the phone from Amazon, it is Amazon who would provide me with a unlock code. I chatted with an Amazon CSR as well and they forwarded my query to their wireless team who will respond in a day or two.Anyone else have the same experience?Edit: Amazon's ""Wireless"" CSR came back with a canned reply that said - ""Sorry to hear you are having problems with your purchase.

"8082","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I am a loyal t-mobile customer. I was one year into my unbelievably inexpensive renewed contract when my phone died. Let me go back and say that the reason my monthly contract is so cheap is because I opted to pay full price for phones to roll the savings into my bill. Anyway, instead of looking to buy a cheap used replacement phone, I looked at prepaid options. Amazon had the cheapest deals. I ordered the Samsung Exhibit II. When it arrived, I stuck my sim card in (instead of the prepaid sim), turned it on and started using it immediately. I was blown away by all the features. Wi-Fi calling is the best. I had mediocre signal strength with my previous phone, but when using my home internet I never drop calls. Using the Wi-Fi at home also saves on data, even though I have unlimited data. My only complaint is the amount of bloatware that came installed on the phone. It takes up a substantial amount of space. What I did was purchase a 32gb micro sd card and saved all of my downloads to the card. I also purchased a tpu gel skin case for the phone through Amazon. It offers excellent protection without bulk. Another feature I enjoy is the front facing camera. I skype with family using the camera and my home internet for free! Overall, this is a fantastic phone. I've owned it for a month and it has worked flawlessly.","990","Samsung","8"

Power/volume buttons are in a terrible place. When I hold the phone to press the power button, I also press the volume buttons! This is a terrible design.2. Phone is very slippery, especially if you are holding it awkwardly due to #1 above. You will need a case to protect from falls and drops.3. The virtual keyboard is not good if you have even normal size fingers. I spend a lot of time backspacing to correct the wrong letters as I type.4. Sometimes phone loses settings after powering off and powering on again (e.g., vibrate).5. Bluetooth/SYNC issue where the phone disconnects randomly from SYNC in the car without any warning. This is terrible as I miss calls while driving. Can't use cell and drive so this is key!!!6. Poor poor poor battery life. I don't really surf a lot (except for the ocassional Pandora session) and rarely use the phone while in the office, so why is the battery being drained so low every day?? Probably due in part to the...7....crap software that is loaded and running on this phone. Just don't have the patience to try and figure out how to remove the useless junk. I have seen mulitple posts on how to do this so it's worth looking for, if interested.Overall, it is not a bad phone, but it is frustrating to have to deal with all the minor issues.

I decided to go to the T-Mobile store and activate it there and the guy who works there helped me port over my Virgin Mobile number. I took out the Exhibit and I turned it out but it didn't turn out! I was like WHAT?!?! I kept saying in my head, ""Please,please, no, no, no, NO!""It's bricked!

I got this phone in order to get the unlimited text talk and web plan from tmobile. The phone itself is just as good as any other phone on the market and about half the cost. In addition the phone is wifi enabled which allows it to use a wifi connection to extend its network. I live in a very thick apartment complex and couldn't get service with my old verizon phone, but this one gets perfect signal. The only downfall of this phone is that it's not the absolute top quality like some of the other phones when it comes to the processor and video quality.

"8087","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I just about gave up on finding a cell phone and plan that meets my needs and fits my budget. I tried the new HTC Rezound with Verizon, the phone was really nice but Verizon wants an arm and a leg to get minutes, text and web. It came in at almost $90 bucks a month. Sent that back and was looking at a prepaid phone when I ran across this Samsung Exhibit II here at Amazon.I guess it was my lucky day cause this phone is great! Got fast 2 day shipment and activating it at T-Mobile was a snap. Because I was a NEW customer I was able to get the $30 a month plan with 100 minutes, unlimited text and unlimited web. Oh yea, NO 2 year contract! This beats the heck out of those other guys.There is alot of bloatware that everyone mentions but I reduced the number of homescreens from 7 to 3 and put those apps I useon those 3 screens. Also downloaded Juice Defender and Android Booster from the app store to help me with battery and app management. Next I downloaded the Kindle ap and got my books downloaded. Then I downloaded music from my Amazon Cloud player and stored it on the phone.I had a 16gb SD card which I installed and then moved some of the apps to the card which saves space on the internal battery. So far I have no complaints with the phone or T-Mobile. The only improvement I would make would be to move the speaker from the back of the phone to the front.Lastly, I was pleasantly surprised to see a FULL paper phone manual included with the phone.","990","Samsung","8"

"8090","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I got the Exhibit II as a secondary phone. This is a really very good phone for $189.Pros:- Screen size is 3.7"". Not too shabby for a sub-$200 phone. It has multi-touch and screen detailing is crisp.- Decent specs with a single-core 1.0 GHz processor and 4 Gigs of internal memory.- Front-facing camera for video conferencing!! This is what sold me on the phone - the ability to skype or video-gtalk is really nice.- Very good battery life. The phone will easily take you through the day with average use - I get 30 to 40 hours on a single charge.Cons:- You have to deal with a lot of T-mobile bloatware. Of course you can always root the phone and delete most of the bloatware.- T-mobile may give you a very hard time unlocking the phone as it is not purchased through them. Since I travel overseas a lot I needed my phone unlocked. I have read that some individuals have eventually gotten t-mobile to unlock their Exhibit II after several calls. I wasn't that lucky so I had to go elsewhere to unlock mine for about $25.Other:- If you are buying this phone to unlock it and use overseas, check to be sure your network is compatible- For the Exhibit II we have:2G Network GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 19003G Network HSDPA 850 / 1700 / 2100 / 1900- Several countries in Africa and Europe use 900/1800 which means this phone will only get 2g on those networks.

"8091","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","As with my Android tablet, I fell in love with this Android phone. Before I purchased it, I did some research into whether or not I could still use the phone if I had a monthly contract. And I could. All I had to do was call T-Mobile and tell them that I no longer needed a Blackberry data plan and needed their Android one.Pro's:-It's easily rootable. All one has to do is download some drivers for your computer, some app's, and voila. You're done. In fact, rooting your device is encouraged by many in the Android community; unlike those who own iOS devices (Apple actually frowns upon people who do so).-Plenty of apps that you would find on Apple's devices, you can easily find on Android. For example, Siri. Instead, we Android users have something called Iris.-Unlike Apple products, this Android phone actually has a flash for its' camera. Since I take plenty of pictures, I expect my camera's to have flash.Con's:The one thing that really bothers me about this phone is that I couldn't hear people text me when I had the phone locked. With my Blackberry, it would make a noise. It's not a big gripe since I was able to find an app on the Market that took care of this for me. It's called Handcent SMS in case anyone is interested.Otherwise, this phone is perfect!","990","Samsung","8"
"8092","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","Great phone so far after one week, really quite amazing for the price. We have been searching for phones that will switch over to wifi smoothly for talking AND texting, which seems simple but it has not been all that easy. We live outside of any cell phone service area, so this feature is essential. This one works great. We popped in our existing t-mobile sim card (family plan) and it activated without having to talk to anyone at T-mobile. Battery life is a bit short--you won't be able to go for days but it hasn't been a problem.Only other glitch is that the phone will occasionally buzz non-stop if Skype is on and you get a text or something.","990","Samsung","8"
"8093","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","This is a great quality phone with a decent screen size. I was initially afraid it might be a bit too small. I went from a 3.2 inch screen to a 3.7 in screen. Who knew half an inch would make all the difference! Although a 4 inch screen would be nice, I think this screen size is perfect. Not too small. It fits great in the hand.Text Messaging is buggy. If you text more than 1 page of text, it gives you an error. Looks like a lot of people have this problem. I've searched countless forums about it. The only way around it is downloading a different messaging app. The only annoyance is that I can set the new app as my default, but I can't change the icon on the dock to go to my app. The dock icon just goes back to the default messenger. There are apps that change your phone screen and it allows you to customize your dock, but I haven't found one that I like yet.Yes, the phone does come with A LOT of bloatware. I read about this before I purchased the phone. I read many forums and a group finally made the process easy. I am definitely new to the whole rooting process. I wanted to root my old Android phone but it seemed so complicated so I never went through with it. For this phone, there are some smarties out there that made the whole process so simple! Very few and simple steps. Download 2 files (USB drivers and the actual Rooting file), set phone to USB debugging, plug it in, execute rooting and you're done! Install titanium back up app, back up all apps (Just in case you delete the wrong one!), delete the apps that are not needed (List provided by the genius root people). SO EASY! I was a little hesitant in rooting because I was a newbie, but it's super easy and simple. The phone works just fine without rooting. It didn't lag or drain the battery. I went a whole day with moderate use during my work hours and heavy use on wifi when I got home. I still had some juice left the next morning. I only rooted the phone because all the extra apps annoyed me. I didn't want pages and pages of apps that I don't use.I'm still under contract with t-mobile but I wanted a newer smart phone. I had an old T-Mobile MyTouch. The very first version of the MyTouch line. I wanted to upgrade to a bigger and gingerbread android phone but I didn't want to be tied to a 2 year data plan. This is a great alternative to very pricy unlocked phones. Plus, when my contract is up, I can switch to the prepaid plan. I don't need data because I'm usually at home or at work where wifi is available so it's great that I could buy this phone, stick in my sim and I'm good to go. The only issue is that if you don't have a data plan you can't send picture messages. I have read this is an issue with Android and/or T-mobile. It doesn't bother me too much because I don't usually picture messageRegarding that other reviewer that said the phone can't get network calls or texts while on wifi, I don't know what's wrong with their phone but mine works great. I was hesitant to buy the phone because of that review. I'm glad I believed it to be a fluke and bought the phones anyway. Network calls DO work with wifi on. There's absolutely no reason it shouldn't. T-mobile told that person the wrong information!This phone is definitely slippery as other have said. The full body skin helped with that (Offered as a bundle from Amazon). Installation was SUPER easy. I like the soapy water method because it's more forgiving when you place it down crooked. Now I'm just waiting for my case from ebay.Overall it's a zippy phone (even before rooting), way faster than my ancient MyTouch running on Froyo. Very few lags and no ""force closes."" It has the perfect screen size and customizing is so easy. Battery life is great (I was afraid it would be like other smart phones where you charge every 12-15 hours). I am still heavily playing around with it, downloading and customizing, but I would say that I could probably get 2-3 days of regular use. For now, it's what I need for a price I can afford. This is a great phone!","990","Samsung","8"
"8094","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I see this phone as a one for those of us who love the idea of having all that technology in our pockets, but just can't get ourselves to spend hundreds of dollars on a top-of-the-line phone and/or go under a two year contract when plans and deals are changing almost everyday.I upgraded myself to this phone from a T-Mobile (Huawei) Comet, which probably was the lowest spec'ed phone you could get with Android 2.2 installed on it. I used Comet for little less than a year and I got it for 160 bucks - which I thought was a good deal back then, when rest of the options available were at least twice as expensive.Comet was very slow; when I saw Exhibit II for less than 200, I knew it was time for an upgrade.Exhibit II has all the good features that you read on here - which are excellent for the price.Here are the downfalls:1. 1.0 GHz processor is really great, but it is a single core; thus, some (quite little) choppiness or loss of smoothness is observed when you are multi-tasking - insignificant downfall.2. Android 2.3 appeared to me to be less stable than 2.2, as Exhibit II did freeze a couple of times after doing updates or installs and uninstalls. Not that I'm an expert, but I'd say this is expected, because 2.3 is more extensive, more compatible, more versatile. These freeze ups could also be a cause of some on-the-poor-side hardware.. but this is totally a guess.3. Screen is great, camera is borderline good (nothing amazing).. but I'd say, the sound quality is poor, with the most obvious one being the speaker on the back of the phone. It is loud and clear, but lacks depth to the tunes it is playing - sound like cheap laptop speakers as opposed to good laptop speakers. Sad to say (for Exhibit), Comet has a much better speaker (and this is one of the reasons why I'm not throwing Comet away). In addition, I can easily say that the earpiece inside the phone is not a lower-end quality one. The sound is overall is good but just not brilliant - wouldn't expect this from Samsung.Overall, it's a great phone - fast, functional, average up-to-date technology.. but we all know how long that lasts..I would recommend this phone.","990","Samsung","8"
"8095","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","3","I ordered this off amazon, tax free, with two day shipping. Arrived in a timely manner, but just got to activate it this morning. Activation is very simple. The kit includes a sim card, which you just insert above (and to the left) of the battery in the back. Then you will want to go to t-mobile.com/activation and follow the instructions. It comes with a random $3.34 balance.. for emergency.. instant calling or something I suppose. But following the activation, it takes you to where you can pay for your service online. You can also get those cards at the store, but honestly, it's so easy just to pay online. And then you're good to go. I chose the $30 unlim text/data + 100 min plan. You don't need to go to walmart or tmobile to get this. To my understanding, it is only available for new activations.The price and quality of the phone is all great. One problem I have with it is that... honestly... I'm not really an Android fan. I didn't think I would mind it at all but somehow it really annoys me how much bloatware it comes with. Sure, there are ways to delete it. But people on reviews made it sound 100x easier than what I had to do. I don't really consider myself technologically challenged, but it was hard to find all the steps to uninstall this crap I didn't want. You can't just go to the ""APPLICATIONS"" menu and drag what you don't want to the trash. Why? Everything I've tried to delete just stays there when I go back to the menu. What the hell is that function for then? Why can I not just delete the stuff I don't want? (And there are many.)I'm new to Android so rooting was a brand new concept for me. I must have downloaded 4 different apps off the Android market to no avail. I didn't understand why the hell something called ""______ Uninstaller"" cannot uninstall apps. After a bit of research and trying a bunch of different things, I finally figured it out.I figure I'd type it out in layman's terms for those who have trouble rooting:- Turn on USB debugger (settings>applications>development>usb debugging)- Have the right USB drivers installed ON YOUR COMPUTER (Apparently these are difficult to find. Install the samsung galaxy x drivers from softpedia instead. When I did this, it told me it wasn't installed correctly but I couldn't find a fix so I just ignored it.)- Connect your phone to the computer via usb port- Then you can download SuperOneClick on your COMPUTER. It is a computer application. Extract (it is a zip file) and run. Click on ""root."" (top left big button) It may take a couple minutes. It should say root complete or whatever at the end. And to confirm that it is indeed rooted, you will see a ""Superuser"" icon in the applications folder.- Now you can begin the uninstallation, but that is not all! You have to download some more stuff to uninstall. From the Android market, you can find some apps that will allow you to uninstall items. Android Mate was too advanced for me. You have to know exactly what files you are deleting (which is a constant annoyance.) If you delete the wrong files then your phone might not work or it will brick. Kind of terrifying, considering the price I paid. I used Titanium backup to uninstall items, but you still run the risk of deleting things you need. It is better to ""freeze"" the apps but that is a premium feature, which you must pay for. I also tried Root Uninstaller to no avail. It didn't show any apps besides Market and itself for some reason. I'm sure there's something out there that might be better but, so far, my experience is that these apps are not that user-friendly.Others have claimed that the process above is ""easy"" but it wasn't for me, apparently. Maybe some people know how to do this intuitively, I don't know. But think about it. All I wanted to do was delete pre-installed junk like internet radios and ""MORE FREE APPS!@!!"" apps. But it took entirely way too long. You can just press on any app in iOS until it's shaking and then press X to delete. A couple seconds, max. I don't understand why it is so hard to delete things on the Android (not even including the risk of bricking your phone at every corner.)Aside from my long rant, in the end, it is a good deal for a 4g smartphone and great rates on plans. Still, I'm not too satisfied with Android. I feel like it's one of those apple vs. windows commercials, comparing efficiency. There's a pre-installed anti-virus (free trial for 14 days, then you have to pay). Really? I never even thought that would be an issue with iOS. Obviously these are my opinions, and others will have no problems with the bloatware. I'm a bit OCD and inefficiency is such an annoyance. I just want my phone to run as efficiently and quickly as possible, not having junk on it that tries to make me install more apps or pay for premium services. Yes, the iphone costs way more, but I would still rather have it than Android. That's just me though.EDIT:After a few days of use, I'm getting used to the Android system more. I don't mind it as much, and hopefully it will hold up well. It's still a fantastic deal, and with no contracts none-the-less! In the end, the savings are fantastic. Think about the activation fees and taxes and whatnot when you have to get a phone with a contract. This phone is really a smart purchase.","990","Samsung","8"

So far, I find Tmobile to be of decent quality as far as cellular coverage it's not Verizon, Att or Sprint but hey they have the best prepaid plans so far if your looking to budget.The reason I chose this phone was that it gave me all the apps I had on the iphone and more (although on an android platform), it's 4G and you can't beat $30 a month unlimited text, 4g up to 5g web and 100 minutes, (5g is more than enough), and NO contract, the phone is lightweight somewhat of a cheaper quality than the iphone, but then again it's not an iphone but functions just as well...the battery does drain a bit faster but you can get the juice defender to save on battery...don't like the bloatware but I saw in other reviews you can root to remove unwanted apps which is nice if the instructions are followed correctly without bricking the phone...I'm a huge web browser and find this much faster (4g) than my latest iphone 4g...maybe someday I'll return to my beloved iphone but only when prices come down and att stops throttling the data usage.Overall, this phone works great and I'm pleased...no buyers remorse here :) and no complaints with the service Tmobile offers so farPS: Gotta love Amazon, free 2 day shipping and no tax..set up was easy online or you can also call Tmobile","990","Samsung","8"

"8112","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","Let me begin by stating that I am very pleased, overall. This phone is quite the money-saver, really. Its $200 price-tag really sets the bar for phone companies to deliver quality goods at affordable and reasonable prices. The $30/month plan goes perfectly with this phone and I am looking forward to paying for it. 2-day prime shipping was AWESOME! Immediately after opening the box, I set up my Google account and played around with the phone for a while. It was easy to set up and is easily managed and user-friendly.A few things that I noticed that might be a small annoyance are as follows: slightly unresponsive lock screen, no haptic feedback when typing (however, the camera feature has a haptic feature), pre-installed and unremovable apps/games, lack of ambient light sensor function, poor Wifi connection, and a few other small things.However, many of the features are highly commendable, such as the easy set-up, great screen, lightweight physique, pre-installed apps for video chat and wifi calling, etc.For the $200, this phone is DEFINITELY worth it, especially for those seeking to avoid a 2-year contract. This phone is not only great for the price, but actually great.P.S. - I suggest getting some screen protectors and an SD card. The phone has a few gigs of built-in memory, but an SD card will definitely come in handy, such as the 16GB microSD found here on Amazon.","990","Samsung","8"

The phone, out of box, has some pretty bad texting problems that can be found across the t-mobile board (wish I had seen those earlier!). Messages fail constantly; some messages that fail have more than 160 characters, other are short messages. It took me five minutes to get an ""Ok!"" sent to one of my employees.

(lasts as good as 24 hours with a very basic usage (calls, data and sync emails) and about 12 hours with extensive usage (wifi, gps etc.,). The screen size is the biggest advantage. The camera is really nice (I am wondering on critical reviews on camera). The front camera is just a VGA, still good for video chatting using skype. (not sure whether a skype or Android's bug not detecting the headset during answering skype calls - not a big deal though, just unplug and plug back the audio jack). A good phone if you are a beginner to use smart phones.This is technically the 2nd phone I received with the same order, as the first one's audio jack wasn't giving sound on both sides. Thanks to Amazon, as they replaced a new phone the very next day.Update 1 : Just noticed that, whenever there is no actual 4G coverage (though the network shows as 4G), the speed drops to EDGE instead of 3G. Not sure if this is phone's problem or T-Mobile's.Update 2: After 4 weeks I found couple of weird things. The mobile restarted itself 2 times while I was on a call.

"8128","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","2","I'll make this short and to the point.This phone attracted me because of its rich feature set and low price. Most of my friends were buying smart phones for over $400 dollars, and this phone seemed to be a good deal. I jumped on board as an early adopter back in November 2011, and initially I was very satisfied. I unlocked the phone for using on another network, and everything worked well. I browsed the internet wherever I went. I sent email. I watched YouTube videos on the go. I used Google Maps for navigating.However, after a few weeks I began noticing that there was a huge problem with text messages. At random times text messages would simply come back saying ""Message not sent"".This frustrated me to no end. The bug seemed random, and happened regardless of message length and signal strength. The same messages would almost never send successfully, no matter how many times I retried. This happens more for some contacts than others. And, to make matters worse, sometimes the texts actually do get through, but the error is still there. A friend once received 12 copies of the same text from me.Now, a significant percentage of text messages simply doesn't get through. This is a basic feature that breaks the phone for me. The bug has been acknowledged by a T-Mobile rep on their so-called tech support forums. What a joke. Using third party apps like ""Go SMS Pro"" hasn't helped me, although it has been suggested as a fix on the forums.[...]This is just like buying a car only to find out that the engine doesn't work. All the computers, GPS, air conditioning, leather seats, and other bells and whistles are perfect. But it doesn't work for what you really needed it to do in the first place.Please, stay far away from this phone. For your own sake.

"8129","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","Not because the phone itself is revolutionary. It's an average phone if you look at the specs. It's because the phone allows average people to afford a quality smart phone with an affordable plan. I switched from the OG Droid on Verizon to the Exhibit II on T-Mobile two months ago, and I couldn't be more pleased.Mobile phone companies in the U.S. have been fleecing the public with smart phone plans for years. The Samsung Exhibit II 4G, along with T-Mobile's $49.99 ""all you can eat"" plans (available in both contract and prepaid flavors depending on your preference), represents a milestone that should change the industry, if only more people knew about it.First of all, make no mistake: this is a solid mid-level Android phone at a bargain-basement price. Great screen, great touch screen response, good performance. It's rootable, so you can remove the bloatware (XDA Developers is a great resource -- Google ""XDA Developers Samsung Exhibit II 4G root"". Once you're rooted, download ""Root Uninstaller"" from the Market and follow XDA's advice about which apps to remove).Let me briefly tell you our story. My wife and I bought Motorola Droids a few years ago for $250 each (2 year contract price!), then paid Verizon $170/month for a family plan with 1400 minutes, data, and text messaging. When it came time to upgrade, we felt that was too much money, downgraded to feature phones (bought from eBay), and started paying $110/month for 1400 minutes, text messaging, and no data.Fast forward to a couple of months ago. Thanks to this product we were able to buy two very good Android phones on Amazon for under $200 each. Brand new, full price, no contract. We are now paying $100/month combined for unlimited talk, unlimited text, and unlimited data. Yes, Verizon's network is better in rural areas. But if you think about it, who needs to pay $1700 extra over the course of a 2 year contract so you have coverage that one day or one week per year you're in BFE? In reality, very few people.But that's not all. Even if you're in BFE, Wi-Fi is ubiquitous. Many campgrounds have it, all McDonalds in the U.S. have it, etc. This is good news because the Exhibit II comes with T-Mobile's fantastic ""Wi-Fi Calling"" feature. This means you can use your phone anywhere in the world with Wi-Fi without paying roaming charges. Or, within old metallic office buildings with Wi-Fi where no cell phones from any provider work. Even Verizon can't beat that. I'm telling you, it works wonderfully. IMO, Verizon's admittedly superior wireless network is not worth anything close to $70/month more than T-Mobile's for the vast majority of users, especially when you factor in Wi-Fi calling. Your priorities may vary.In short, this is the best value in cell phones today. You get a mid-level Android phone without a contract for under $200. You get a plan that lets you use its full potential for only $50/month, from a legitimate national provider. You get this for less than many smart phones cost with a 2-year contract.I applaud T-Mobile and Samsung for producing a high-quality offering that makes smart phones accessible and affordable to average people. I hope this becomes a trend with other carriers.","990","Samsung","8"

I ran out of minutes, but additional minutes are only 10 cents per min.This phone was not easy to use at first and is not very universal (Does not support some languages) The typing recognition is very frustrating (Compared to an iPhone). However, if you get used to it after a while, it will be okay and your errors will reduce dramatically (Takes practice). Otherwise, it has a large built in memory. Lot's of preinstalled apps that you can't delete from T-mobile, but it doesn't matter since you have a lot of space. Would recommend to buy an SD card to go with it.

I will be recalling tmobile hopfully they will send me a replacement, i Know few people with same phone and they havn't had any problems, maybe my phone is just a defect.Update: Now this phone started acting up with more problems low ringer, other party would not hear me or hear them, contacted tmobile finally agreed on sending me a refurbished one (broken one which have been fixed) but there's a catch a $20 service fee ( What???) you pay $20 they will send you a refurbished phone for your new phone, yeah T-mobile wants to cash in on the one year warranty that this has already has, i said no i will report to BBB.

Consider this one: http://www.amazon.com/T-MOBILE-SAMSUNG-EXHIBIT-QUBITS-PACKAGING/dp/B005QUE8Y8/ref=pd_bxgy_cps_img_bDon't expect too much from a $200 phone, though.

"8136","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","I bought 2 since they seem to have good review. It took several days to transfer the numbers from our old phones (contract T-mobile regular cell phones) to these phone prepaid, but finally they did successfully. Sound quality is much better than our old cellphones. We have only used them couple weeks to provide comments, but we noted couple things are not very intuitive like making calls (you swipe the green button instead of press on it). You have to really read the manual or search for answers online. Another thing is the microSD memory slot is under the back cover, so it is less convenient to swap the chip in and out.So far we still like this model. It can do a lot of things: large calculator, calendar, and 2 cameras, ...We have not activated any Google account from it since we are concerned about the security and bloatware.","990","Samsung","8"

I loved it and all the different apps available, e.g., Orbot, Kindle, History Eraser, Maps, Scanner Radio, TeleNav GPS, Bible, Google Sky Map, Kitchen Timer, Tunein Radio, etc., etc., etc....All fun toys to play with, but lately this year I have to continuously reboot the phone to get it to make a simple call! I'm really missing my old reliable flip T- mobile phone.","990","Samsung","8"
"8146","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","The phone arrived in Spanish, luckily I understand enough Spanish to follow the prompts to change it to English...I was actually trying to replace the same model phone I had (that stopped working properly after almost 2 years of ownership)...But this Amazon Samsung Galaxy replacement does not work like my original phone within 4 days of having it...It would no even accept my Rhapsody Subscription, But my old phone did...I spend a lot of time in pharmacies and doctors office waiting rooms and use music to occupy my anxiety!!! It's as this phone had been tweaked before I got it. None of the ear buds I have will work with it (It still plays loud and various ear buds seem loose). I am in need of a dependable phone because of medical conditions...The calling screen completely blacks out after the person on the other end answers their phone, making it impossible to press 1 for English, or any other prompts...Other screens will pop up randomly too. Last night I got a text and when I tried to read it, a blue strip appeared across horizontally the text about 1/2 inch wide! And the top banner turns blue from time to time...It works sporadically where I can sometimes make calls, so I am only keeping the phone until my replacement arrives. I have contacted the Amazon Seller and they have told me to print a return label for a full refund. My medical condition and my daughter's medical condition dictates that I cannot be without mobile communication to each other and, or EMS. So as soon as my new phone arrives, I will be returning this phone for a full refund.","990","Samsung","8"
"8147","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","Exhibit 2 is all you can ask for at price <$200. The phone is really fast with 1 Ghz processor once its rooted though. The screen is clear and bright even during mid day, email and messages work nicely with push notifications from gmail app. The camera is ok, both front and back cameras work fluidly during skype chats and music is clear with 5.1 surround sound on headphones. The touch screen is very receptive although at times you feel your don't have the smooth surface to use swype effectively, trick is not to actually clean your screen so often. Browsing is good with Wifi and GPS working great and connect at N speeds if your router supports.One more thing about GPS, you DON'T need to have a data plan for GPS to work. You can pre catch using google maps a certain area of 10 miles radius and use GPS to navigate without data plan, it works. Also you can use all those health and fitness apps (although I recommend my tracks by google) to record the track you run/jog/cycle and then come back home to overlay the map and share. Once again GPS does NOT require data plan.Yes as everyone else mentioned, the available ram is only 356 MB and not the entire 512 MB. If you don't root the phone, there are bunch of apps from T-mobile which will eat up all the ram and usually hovers at around 315 MB, once rooted you really feel the speed of the phone, and ram hovers at 250 MB, ofcourse depending upon the programs you run.","990","Samsung","8"
"8148","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","I say almost awesome for my title because of one big issue. The phone even with a 1Ghz processor becomes sluggish when too many apps are used or even one app like the GrooVeIP or GPS or streaming music for an extended period of time anywhere from 30 to 40 minutes on wards. My wife's Samsung Transform Ultra from Boost mobile with just 800Mhz processor does not do it for similar functions. But the issue is fixed after a reboot. Other than this its an excellent phone especially for someone who does not use all the above mentioned apps or uses them casually its an excellent phone. That is the only reason I give 4 stars. I do not get 4G for T-mobile where I live but it works great on my WiFy.","990","Samsung","8"

At the time I wrote ""best no contract phone out there"" and so on which in hindsight sounded better than reality. Number one there were few no contract options out there at the time. Secondly for the nearly two years I owned this piece of junk, it turned out to be one of the worst choices I could have made for a phone. It was slow, froze up all the time and crashed like cars on a highway in a snowstorm. No amount of custom ROMs could save it. Now I wouldn't even give this away knowing the grief it would cause someone else.Soon it will be 2016 and there are plenty of great deals on GOOD phones now unlike in 2012. So if you buy this and complain about later, you are only to blame, not the phone or the seller.","990","Samsung","8"
"8152","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","This is my first ""smart"" phone if that is the correct term for this phone. For the past almost five years I have been using the same old Nokia - which served me well. I wanted another Nokia but I also wanted Android OS, and was told by Nokia that it was not available on their phones. My Nokia was so old that I think it is like the one Elvis used. Anyway, it had a rotary dial.As I say, so far so good. The biggest drawback, as mentioned by many others, is the number of apps icons that need purging - I won't use all of them, maybe three or four. I have had a T-Mobile prepaid plan since 2007, so converting this phone to that plan was not too difficult. My Nokia SIM card was not recognized by the Samsung, for whatever reason, so I first copied my ""contacts"" from the Nokia SIM card to the Nokia memory. I then placed the Exhibit II SIM card(the one that came with the package) into the Nokia and copied the contact info to the new SIM card. This card was then placed into the Exhibit II and viola! It didn't recognize the existence of a SIM card. What now?After fumbling around a bit and recalling how often I have had to reboot the set-top box for my Fios service, I said, ""Aha!"" I removed the battery and reinstalled it - We now have ignition. So, I signed up for another 1000 minutes on my plan and I'm good to go.One disappointment - and maybe it's just me - but I connected the Exhibit via the mini USB, to my iMac and the iMac did not recognize the device. If anyone is knowledgeable about this connection, please advise.For now, it looks like I take the phone to work to download the necessary drivers and apps required to ""root"" the unwanted apps icons as directed by others on this review site.Not having had any other ""smart"" phone to judge this one by, I think I am going to really enjoy this phone. However, I don't text at all (not yet anyway), and I don't intend to watch movies or TV, but it might be nice to sync with my computer at home, via Evernote, once I figure out how to get it on board.Hope some of this will help others with whatever they are considering in the way of a new phone.EDIT: So far, not so good. I continue to be unable to remove the App icons.....even though I have a gmail account, I can't even download the Superoneclick App recommended here, to root it. Too much the neophyte to know whether it is the phone, me, or the prepaid T-Mobile plan, that is the source of the frustration. The next step is to beg the guys at T-Mobile for direction. So we will remain at 5 stars, for now.And, to the person, JJ, who wants my old Nokia, sorry that rotary phone sold on Creg's List for a song-and-dance.gydancer","990","Samsung","8"

"8155","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","It has been 1.5 month since I bought this item. It is time to make a fair judgement now.[Appearance]----------------This is good looking device with thin design. Screen size is 3.7 inch.[Usage]----------------Exhibit II is quite light. It feels good in hand. You mostly need to use your both hands to handle because of Android's menu and virtual keyboard design.[Speed]----------------It takes about a minute to boot device which is reasonable I guess. This is not fast device even it has 1 GHz processor. Because processor speed is an illusion in Android devices. Don't get fulled by numbers, just think about what you get. If you compare Samsung Exhibit II with iPhone which has equivalent hardware you will understand what I mean. My conclusion is Android is much slower operating system than iPhone. What you pay is what you get.[Camera]----------------Front cam is an ordinary one that is reasonable for video calls. Rear camera is 3MP with flash support. Photo quality is not fancy but not too bad at all.[Operating System]----------------This device is running Android Gingerbread(2.3.x). Android is Java dependent system which makes it running slow. However it is still better than Windows based mobile operating system. You can experience weird resets sometimes don't worry. There is no news about Android 4.0 update. I guess they may not prepare 4.0 update for Exhibit II.[Connectivity]----------------3G/4G networks are available for internet connection. Bluetooth is available for data exchange.[Software]:----------------t is coming with bunch of useless T-Mobile software. You cannot directly remove them they are defined as system component. You need to root and remove them. You will use Android Market for new software. Android Market is still poor if you compare it with iPhone apps.[Battery life]----------------This part is really crucial. I bought this device to use 4G service. That is why I always enable either WiFi or 4G. Data backup and synchronization services are always running too. Average battery life is 20 hours for me. But there is a significant inconstancy in battery consumption. I usually use similarly each day but sometimes battery is draining in 8 hours, but rarely it is draining in 30 hours. I have no idea about that.[GPS/Navigation]----------------At the beginning GPS signal was frequently dropping but it is quite consistent nowadays. Use Google Navigation software. It is much better software than other navigation software which comes default.[Conclusion]----------------First off all you need to know that you are not buying an iPhone equivalent smart phone. I don't know the whole market but this might be one of the best smart phones in terms of performance/cost. If disadvantages don't bother you too much this might be right smart phone for you.I hope this review is helpful for you.","990","Samsung","8"

"8157","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","This is the most expensive piece of junk that I have purchased from Amazon. I've had it less than a month and it's broken already. It's never been dropped or abused since I've had it and it worked fine until the end of last week. Now when I go to hang up a call the phone key pad disappears and there's no way to hang up so I end up leaving one of those annoying long voice mails with just background noise. Even when it worked properly I wasn't real impressed with it anyway. It's built and feels very cheap (cheesy) like something you would win in one of those crane machines.

"8159","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","I thought I'd take the plunge and join the android craze. I just want my Blackberry back. This phone sucks monkey balls.- The battery life sucks. I have shut down everything in the background that should be sucking it dry (GPS, Bluetooth, etc) and I'm still charging it at least twice a day. I work on an ambulance.... I NEED to have a phone that I know will be charged in order to give patient reports. I can take this phone off the charger before I leave for work and by lunch time it's almost dead.- I have VERY small hands... I buy little kids gloves.... and even *I* can't text on this thing for crap. I feel like I should send out decoder rings with every text message.- Talk about slow. Even after I rooted it, it's still insanely slow to respond. I end up in a loop every day because I hit a button then wait 60 seconds for it to respond, hit the button again only to have whatever it is pop up then go away again. Makes me want to bang my head against the wall.- My god the fingerprints. I spend all day wiping them off. One more reason I hate touch screens. With a passion.- Even rooted it's a train wreck. I thought getting rid of all the bloatware would make a difference, but it doesn't.- This thing looses signal ALL the time. I got full strength in my house with my Blackberry... I barely get 2 bars here.- T-Mobile isn't even selling this POS anymore.- It takes it HOURS to charge fully. Sometimes it isn't even charged over night.It does take decent pics and video. The back speaker is surprisingly loud.I'm not sure I could hate this phone more all in all. I have ordered a new battery to see if that solves some of my issues. I'm not holding my breath and I can't wait to get rid of it.","990","Samsung","8"
"8160","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","I initially was really pleased with this phone. Setup was a snap and the phone was fully functional.However, what I found was that it had stability issues. It would often freeze running an app or unexpectedly restart the OS. When it froze, I would have to pull the battery to recover. Usually I had the problem at least once every day or two; but sometime several times in a right in a row it would crash. I installed the ""Gas Buddy"" app after the first week and found that using that app would consistently crash the phone. Being my first android phone, I asked other android users about stability and found their phones ran for weeks or months w/o issues.I found a firmware update on t-mobile site that was supposed to address ""stability"" issues[...] and was able to load it (Android version 2.3.6 / Software T679UVLE1) manually using the Samsung Kies tool (OTA update was no longer available from t-mob); however, it did not resolve the problem. After two weeks; I returned this phone after seeing a lot of similar issues reported on the online forum. Too bad; I really liked the phone other than the stability problems.I replaced it with a Samsung Blaze 4G and although I have only had it for a day I have not been able to crash it; even with the same ""gas buddy"" app that always crashed the Exibit. The Blaze also has a dual core 1.5Ghz processor versus the single core 1.0Ghz processor of the Exhibit and twice the RAM of the Exhibit. I did not think the Exhibit was particularly slow, but the Blaze is much faster on everything and noticeably more responsive running a very similar build of android 2.3.6 compared to the Exhibit.","990","Samsung","8"
"8161","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","3","I love this phone! There's so many reasons why this is such a great phone, here's a few off the top of my head...1. Low price for an unlocked full featured phone (have to wait 60 days to unlock free)2. Large User base and developer/hacker base. Plenty of Samsung Exhibit II user forums to get most of your newbie questions answered3. Lots of inexpensive accessories/batteries/cases. I paid $13 for a bundle that included 2 batteries/charger/gel case/screen protector4. Lots of useful info by other owners/users if you read the reviews here5. Great multimedia Android phone. I just finished watching the latest Transformers movie on the phone with Netflix!6. Excellent T-Mobile 4G network7. Excellent, inexpensive prepaid plans. I pay only $30 per month using the Walmart 100 min/unlimited data/text plan8. Turn your phone into a wireless hotspot for only $15/month and run your laptop and up to 5 wifi devices using your phone as a wifi hotspot.9. Use your Gmail and Google Calendar and Google Maps10. Great GPS functions and mapping11. Facebook, Meetup.com, Metro.net etc. most of the websites that I frequent have apps available12. microSDHC slot to add up to 32gb of memory13. Camera, voice/audio recorder14. Free wifi calling using Google Voice and GrooveIP. Takes a little messing around but once you get it, you'll love it and not use up your 100 minutes. Buy the$5.00 full version of GrooveIP and don't bother with the free/crippled version.14. Plenty of hacks to root this phone and get rid of bloatwareI bought this phone from Amazon and use the Walmart/Tmobile $30 prepaid plan giving me unlimited data/texting and 100 minutes of voice calls. But with the FREE WiFi calling (see #14) I use less than 50 minutes a month as I'm always around a wifi network. If I manage to exceed the 100 minutes, I pay 10 cents a minute... big deal... Later this month, I'm gonna try using the phone as a wifi hotspot ($15/mo) and if it works well at home, I'll dump my cable service that I pay $136/month for cable internet and tv!Just re-upped with Netflix for $8/month for unlimited instant videos as they've added a lot of movies to their catalog and don't bother with the mail in DVD's anymore... Although I did just buy a Blu-Ray player... The Netflix movies play great... well, I was using my cable/wifi connection to watch a movie. I haven't tried watching a video on just the 4G connection yet.Oh, I live at the bottom of a canyon in the Hollywood Hills and most of the other service providers I would not get any reception but with T-Mobile I get a solid 3-4 bars!Cons:1. Battery life is not too long if you are a heavy web user. But buy a couple of spare batteries ($7ea) and no problemo...2. Phone is small and slippery standard, so get the gel case and that will fix the problem and protect the phone3. Seems I can't view my Amazon Prime free videos on the phone. But maybe it's possible and I just haven't figured it out yet...Yeah, I'm a huge fan... this is a great deal for the phone and low monthly cost for a prepaid/no contract unlocked phone.UPDATE 9-2013: I suppose I've downloaded too many apps. My web browsing and operation of the phone has slowed considerably. I am now planning to root my phone and remove all apps that are bloatware and not needed. Thus at this time, I'm down grading this review from 5 stars to 3 stars. This is a single core processor, so my next phone will most likely be a quad core or no less than a dual core processor. If after I root the phone and it enhances the performance back to acceptable levels, I'd bump the rating back up. zxcvb","990","Samsung","8"

"8179","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","I am using it with T-mobile monthly4G $30 for 100 min and unlimited (5GB) data. My wife has Virgin mobile LG Optimus V with $35 or $25 (price increased last year, but previous subscribers still pay $25) / month no contract for 300 min and unlimited (2GB) 3G data.Pros.1) Hardware faster and better compared with LG Optimus V2) 4G is faster than 3GCons.1) It is T-mobile! Monthly4G $30 for 100 min and unlimited (5GB) data plan is offered at WalMart or online only, T-Mobile web-site is glitchy. I could not complete activation online, by phone T-Mobile will try to rip you off $50 a month. T-mobile promised to change the plan in 10 min, but I had to call them several times.2) It is T-mobile! Samsung Exhibit II 4g specs has FM radio hardware built-in, but FM radio is removed from t-mobile version by t-mobile request in order to suck your 4G data limit.3) It is T-mobile! It has preinstalled Carrier IQ, which is keystroke logging and location tracking software, which can intercept text messages. Even information that should be transferred only within encrypted sessions is captured in plain text by Carrier IQ. Worse Carrier IQ is integrated with task manager and cannot be easily uninstalled (I have not found uninstallation way yet).4) It is T-mobile! Besides Carrier IQ phone has a lot of preinstalled crapware. LG Optimus V from Virgin Mobile is practically clean compared with Samsung Exhibit II 4G.5) It is T-mobile! Phone has calling over IP using your wi-fi network, but T-mobile will rip off your monthly minutes or charge you 10 cents a minute over 100 minutes for using call over your wi-fi. To avoid it you need to use Skype or Google talk (GrooVe IP) over wi-fi or 4G. 5GB limit is sufficient, but you need to spend your time again to configure GrooVe IP.Bottom line.Phone is good, but avoid T-mobile and Samsung (Samsung preinstalled Carrier IQ on many phones), I suggest to chose Virgin Mobile and LG unless you really need 4G speed and do not care about your privacy. They have LG Optimus V really cheap. Alternatively you can invest your time and install custom firmware for this phone, but this is a new model, and there is not so much choice available yet (unlike Galaxy S or LG Optimus V). There is no cyanogenMod for this phone yet. Probably better to wait a half year before dealing with this phone unless you are going to contribute into custom mode developing yourself (see discussing below).Update:Installed Titanium backup (backup system), RebelROM (custom firmware), GrooVe IP (free calling using google voice works fine over wi-fi and 4g), juice defender (save your precious bodily fluids, battery power). Never automatic update phones with custom ROM, no factory restore... Everything clean and working, but too much work required. Cleaning other Android phones, including Samsung Galaxy S and LG Optimus, is much simpler and faster. One star for wasting my time, five star for the phone potential with future better custom ROM (waiting for cyanogen mode).","990","Samsung","8"
"8180","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","The Samsung Exhibit II 4G is a great phone. The Amazon price for this phone was 100.00 cheaper than the T-mobile price. I researched this phone and this phone has met my expectations and more. I previously had a Blackberry 9700.The TeleNav GPS app that had a monthly fee is a free app on this phone. Also, includes the Google navigation and maps. So 2 Navigation apps for free.The Voice Search works as well as the Iphone voice search app. The phone is easy to use and set-up. If you dont turn off the apps running in the background the battery will die in 5hrs. So, turn off the background apps, backout of the apps no longer in use. My battery last at least 12 hrs-14hrs.The only negative is , the screen washes out in the bright sun. For the money, and 30-50 dollars a month( depending on the plan us choose) you can't get a better phone. It is a great phone. i just set up Kies air which I can view on my PC everything on my phone, pictures, messages, videos etc. Supports Adobe Flash player which my Blackberry 9700 did not. I could on.

I had a couple quick questions right now that you guys could probably answer. I want to use the prepaid $30 plan that walmart offers but you can't get through the t-mobile store...so buying this phone on amazon...do I still need to buy a sim card activation kit or will it come with a new sim card I can use to get the $30 plan? Some people have been saying that you need to buy the phone from walmart to take advantage of the plan - but others say you need to buy an activation kit. I was wondering if ordering a new one on amazon will be sufficient without the kit. Also, on a 100 minute plan, I am worried I may go over, but I was thinking - Skype doesn't use minutes, I can just use the data for that, correct? Sorry if these questions have already been answered - I just want to buy the activation kit online now so I can be ready for tomorrow if I need to buy it. Don't want to have to wait for it to ship here though. Thanks everyone!","990","Samsung","8"
"8182","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","This is my first smart phone. It has a lot of functions and I haven't accessed them all yet. Three things I want to mention: first, as many know and are unhappy about, the daily battery life is not very long. I followed others advice and turned off most of the loaded applications and selected the battery saving selections found under Settings. Still, you'll be recharging the phone every day, since I don't even use it every day or have it on all day at a time.Second, as opposed to my Samsung not-smart phone which turned on right away, the Exhibit you have to press the power button 3-4 seconds before it lights up, awkward and annoying. Then it is a almost 30 seconds before it is booted up.Thirdly,and Most Important, right from the beginning every few days or so when I turned on the phone I would get a black field on the screen with the white-lettered phrase ""RAM dump mode Cause: Forced download"", at which point I could do nothing with the phone, not even turn it off. I would have to open it up and pull the battery, like a forced powerdown on a computer. After reinserting I could boot up again. No one seemed to know what this was about, so I called Samsung. The customer rep talked me into the settings selections to find some codes. One of them, the ""kernel version"" she identified as not the code for the version with which Samsung programs the phone. The phone had arrived in a brand-new T-Mobile Samsung box and packaging, but somehow it seems the phone had been unofficially ""modified"". The customer rep didn't know how this would have occurred. Samsung e-mailed me a UPS prepaid return label and had me send it back to their service center in Texas for ""re-flashing"". Samsung sent me an e-mail on January 27 notifying that they had received the phone and then sent another one on February 2 notifying that they had shipped it back to me. As I am writing this and wondering when the phone will be delivered and thinking perhaps I should hold off on this review until I've tried the phone again,I thought to check the tracking code Samsung sent me. I just cheked the UPS tracking and it said the delivery was today, 2 hours ago, ""left at front door"". I went to check and there it was! I have booted it up. So far so good... we'll see if the gremlin is actually gone. I can say that Samsung customer service is excellent.","990","Samsung","8"

"8185","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","Ordered this phone for my 17 year old son. He was previously on a Verizon plan; basic phone with 450 min (he would use between 1 to 5 min per month, what a waste - it was all texting) & unlimited text. I was paying 62.00 per month with my 22% discount from work for 2 years. Once I was off contract I cancelled Verizon and the search was on. He wanted a smart phone, but I did not want to be tied to a 2 year contract paying over 100.00 a month. This phone is great and the plan is outstanding for someone who does not use alot of minutes, texts all the time and wants all the features of a smart phone.","990","Samsung","8"
"8186","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","I have been a Tmobile prepaid customer for about six years now. I use fifty to a hundred dollars worth of time a year. Service was good until I put a tin roof on my house and it blocked the signal. I knew Tmobile let you access their network through a home wireless so I went looking for a new GSM phone with WiFi capabilities. The ones I liked were way expensive without a contract but I got serious when my old RAZR started giving me trouble around Christmas.I found this one on Amazon and started looking at the specs and reading the reviews. I needed a phone with WiFi for the house. I wanted one that would play my music. I wanted one that I could use my existing prepaid simm without buying a data plan. Not as simple as it sounds but this phone performs the functions quite well. In addition I installed SKYPE and it works perfectly in the house. I use a SKYPE out subscription for my long distance calls (I am on prepaid remember and even though the phone connects through my WiFi it uses minutes) and all the long distance calls for a year are $30.The battery could last longer but it is acceptable if I charge it every night. As others have stated the bloatware is horrific and I will fix this as soon as I root the phone in the next few days. This should also help with the battery life.The sad thing is I went to my local world wide everything for everybody department store looking for accessories. A silicone skin, some screen protectors and so on. Not a thing and they sell this phone. They did have two isles of iphone accessories but then they don't sell iphones at that particular store.I am just getting started. I will check back if any thing really good or surprising happens. OH and anything bad.ONE MONTH AFTER PURCHASEI rooted the phone and cleaned up the bloatware. Put in a 16Mb Micro SD and lots of music. I am on a road trip and use the SKYPE for calls anywhere I stop with WiFi. Loaded some useful free apps and a few paid ones. For the most part I mostly use it to make and receive calls but the music is nice when no acceptable radio stations are in my area.","990","Samsung","8"

Just kidding, that would be outrageous and very difficult. I do use it for navigation, Pandora, Instagram, Hill Climb Racing, internet, texting, calling, and general jagaloonery. The camera isn't bad. I do wish it had an auto dimming/brightening feature for the screen, but just download a widget that lets you adjust it and you're fine. I don't understand why you have to press ""OK"" after entering your PIN to unlock it, but whatever. Oh also it's a great compact size. Fits well in the pocket. The vibrator sucks. I never feel it vibrate. Oh and a couple times the clock was off by a couple hours and my alarm didn't go off. It's an adventure, this phone. You never know what's going to happen. It's like oh hey let me call Janice and you press the numbers and hit dial and you don't know if it's going to call Janice right away, 2 minutes from now, or never! hahahaha!!!! I will say it's better than an iPhone in that if someone stole my friend's iPhone and smashed it with a hammer he would be heart broken that he lost all that money, whereas if a hooligan snatched my Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G from me and smashed it with a hammer I would just laugh and then by like 3 more of these for the price of an iPhone.

I noticed that the phone reached its discharge battery level relatively quickly, up to 2 days which decreased steadily to 8hrs. This is not acceptable for my needs. The Android OS that came with the phone was up to my expectations with some features hard to use and hard to find but nevertheless helpful (for myself for some I believe). The response or speed was also fine (at 1GHz system clock for the application processor). Display was also fine (resolution/colors). Touch was sluggish. The worst thing was that the phone went simply DEAD after one week of light use!!! I'd expect more that one week, and this experience was simply not worth it. Sorry folks but this is a part of my story. I could not charge the phone, could not power it up could do nothing against it. Looks like the dynamic memory (RAM) lost its configuration and the system could not recover from this fault ever again - the last message from this phone: ""ramdump while uploading"".

You have to wait a minute (literally) and then, if you're lucky, it will work. I have antivirus installed and know that the phone is clean. It's great with using apps and overall I like the phone. It's just a few quirks that irritate me and prevent me from giving it a better review. It's still not bad for the money.

After about two weeks of going back and forth, I gave up, it wasn't worth it the energy being spent. In addition, the screen just goes black/blank for several seconds before getting to its destination. Battery life is awful (even with no apps running). Major delays moving from task to task. Adjusted settings so screen would stay on during calls, but it still goes blank. Phone get very hot on just a single, 20-minute call. Volume on calls not good at all.

My quarrel with this phone is perhaps not even with the hardware, rather with it's Android OS deployment. The issue is that of stability.

I signed up for Google voice and installed Groove Ip app ($5) to make Voip call over 4g data network (I want to use less than that 100minutes per month allowance).Prior to this phone, I had a LG Optimus T (1st generation) so this is the step up in term of speed (4g data and 1 GHZ processor) for me. Also the screen is a bit bigger and the pictures and color are lovely.The phone is capable for wifi hotspot/sharing, but I'll need to root it (/w SuperOneClick) to get around any tmob restriction regarding to wifi hotspot.

"8210","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","The mobile is excellent for the price-fast enough for my mobile needs while on 4g-and connects effortlessly with WiFi. One downside is being able to shut off the shutdown tone (was able to download Silent Boot app for booting up silently) and that the mobile won't autostart with an alarm set (found out this was not available on Android OS). Apparently one can root the OS to change the shutdown tone (Linux users will recognise this function) but I don't want to void any warranty at this point.Samsung mobile phones that I have owned have been consistently very good to excellent (the others were Java-based mobiles). Samsung support was informative when I asked them about the auto-start with the alarm.Be aware that this mobile does ship with a T-Mobile activation kit-so one does not need to buy an additional kit. I had contacted Amazon about the activation kit being included when I read another reviewer's post to verify, but unfortunately the chat agent told me the wrong information (said that there was not an activation kit inlcuded). Sure enough, the mobile ships with everything you need except at microSD card (if you want more data storage). However, all was made right, I was able to return the additional activation kit I ordered, and Amazon acknowledged their error in the chat session.","990","Samsung","8"
"8211","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","After coming across T-Mobile / Walmart's $30 monthly plan, I started looking out for a phone that can connect on T-Mobile's 4G network. The two other candidates (Galaxy S II and the not-yet-available Galaxy Nexus) are all above $500, and I'm not sure I want to spend so much on a phone. Then I came across this one.It lacks some of the other features I'm interested in. I'd like to have a good camera, this one is about average. I'd like to play with NFC. And dual processors would be nice in some situations. And I'd like to have Gorilla Glass on the front. But I'm not prepared to pay full retail for a Galaxy S II. Contracts don't make sense in my situation when I take the total cost of ownership into account - I don't use the phone enough to justify the price.For the price, though, this is an amazingly good phone. The display is crisp, the UI is responsive. Voice is clear, and it gets better reception than my other phone (a clamshell feature phone). It's easy to root, which you'd need to do if you want to uninstall some of the bloatware T-Mobile put in there. It won't win any design awards, but it looks good. It has a 3.5mm headset jack, LED flash, takes microSD memory. The micro USB port is protected behind a sliding door.Activation was painless and can be done online. The SIM card and all other information is included, and if you don't have the box handy and don't want to remove the battery, you can get the IMEI by dialing ""*#06#"" - it'a also easier to read this way. There's $3.34 on the card, so you will need to add money if you want to activate the $30 Walmart plan. Getting T-Mobile to SIM unlock the phone, on the other hand, is painful. When I talked to a rep, she told me my account needs to be active for 60 days. I have another T-Mobile prepaid account that qualifies, but then she said that SIM needs to be in the phone for more than a day, and to call back later. This is despite me explaining I paid full retail for the phone.I've not tested the data network too much yet. I'm sure you can find reviews of T-Mobile's 4G network elsewhere. What little I've tried was quite fast and responsive, but then again, I had 4 bars of 4G signal at that time.Battery life was OK. I did not measure it before I uninstalled the bloatware, so I'm not able to state how much of a difference it made. My email client constantly checking for mail probably is not doing battery life wonders either. And I have it connected to wifi both at work and at home all the time.Added after 5 day road trip : you definitely want to pack a charger with you (or a micro USB cable). Even with limited use and battery saving options turned on, it would be practically depleted after 24 hours.Additional update on battery life : I rooted the phone and deleted, among other things, T-Mobile's My Account and changed my Hotmail app to sync only on demand (instead of Push). Battery life appears to have doubled because of that.The only thing that really irks me about this phone is the inability to connect it to my computer. I had to install Microsoft's MTP Porting Kit on Vista before it would connect, and I couldn't get it to connect to my Windows 7 laptop. Both run 64 bit Windows. Some web forum posts mentioned installing Samsung Kies for the drivers, I'm waiting to see if there's an alternative before doing it. You can use Kies Air to connect to the phone. Kies Air runs a HTTP server on the phone and allows you to connect from another computer's web browser (no software install required) over wi-fi to manage the phone, including file transfers.I had a hard time finding USB Mass Storage Class mode until J. Weng helped me out in the comments. Apparently, it is under ""Wireless and Network"" and is not a permanent setting, but needs to be activated every time you wish to connect.There are a number of errors in the manual. I think one part stated it had 16GB of internal storage. That is incorrect, there's only 4GB of internal storage. The organization of some other parts is confusing, and the section about storage is just one huge mess.It would also be nice to have the micro SD accessible without having to open the battery cover, but it is a small inconvenience.Finally, it would be nice if there are more accessories for this phone. It's still fairly new, but some choices of skin / case would be nice. I did find a very nice case though : T-MOBILE SAMSUNG T679 EXHIBIT II 4G SMOKE BLACK TPU GEL SKIN CASE, IN QUBITS RETAIL PACKAGINGOverall, I'm very happy with the purchase.

"8212","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","I got mine today. It is an excellent entry level smartphone.Good* competitive price as $200* decent size , not too big, not too small* usually fast and can handle netflix smoothly* Internet tethering is supported by default. no hacking is needed at all.* very good screen for text and pictures* the Android installed has some nice features, like a task manager to show and stop running apps. Very handy.Some noticeable issues for the first day.* the back of the case is VERY, VERY slippery. The worst of all phones I ever had. You have to be very careful when holding it. Maybe it is the vendor's intention that you can drop one dead on the ground and buy another one. For now, I applied some black tapes on the back. It is a little better.* I can notice occasionally lag when flipping screens. It is strange considering the 1 GHz processor it has.* The only way to active the screen is trough the power button. It is little annoying since you have to hunt for the power button. I wish it had a physical home key which could active the screen. There might be another way. But at least I don't know yet.* T-mobile's 4G network is slow in my area. I can only get a few hundred kilo bps (less than 1Mbps!) most of the time.* Battery life is a concern. I may have to charge it daily to be safe.Updates after a few days of use.-----------------* camera: the shut lag is very bad. I thought autofocus was a good feature. But it takes 2 seconds to focus. Only good for shooting stationed objects, not for shooting anything moving.* video recording is impressive if you just watch the results on the phone. But uploading it to youtube will lose some quality. Very frustrating about this. Hope there is a way to upload video with its original quality.* The speaker's quality is worse than the T-mobile Comet's speaker. Playing Pandora gives me some high pitch noise. Tolerable but unhappy about this.* For me, there is no choice of $30/month for unlimited data and 100 minute talk from the ""My account"" app of the phone. Not sure if T-mobile dropped this option or what. I do see the choice of $30/month 1500 minutes or messages.* T-mobile's $3 Daily unlimited voice,text and data has some gouging trick. With a payment of $3, I switched my plan to it from as-you-go-plan at around 2pm on one day (Day-1). T-mobile started to charge me again for the next day (Day-2) at 11:45pm , without waiting for 24 hours at all. I also tried to switch back to pay as you go around noon on Day-2. The switch becomes effective immediately, forfeiting all the rest of Daily Unlimited Plan from 12pm to 12:00am. So in reality, I paid $6 for less than 24 hours (from 2pm on the first day to 12pm the next day). Be aware of this kind of trick played by T-mobile!----- update 3 ---------I changed my rating back to 4 star after realizing the screen problem is not an issue. My first impression for its picture display was wrong.I am keeping this phone. It is enjoyable to use it overall, except for the low quality speaker.","990","Samsung","8"

NO Light sensor, (don't see any description of it in the manual, or maybe there is not one). Brightness of this phone is fix! This will drain the battery fast.#2. USB connection is not working on most computer (unlike other Android phones, Samsung's problem, maybe). I tried win7 winXP and Linux. You have to install a driver before transferring files. If you want to use this phone as a usb flash drive, avoid it.#3. Short battery life. Comparing with other android phone with a 1500 mah battery, this phone is poor. Barely last 16 hour. (Can be improve if you root it, or install other rom. But the original rom is NOT a good one)#4. Slow camera operation. (maybe samsung software problem).#5. No FM radio#6. No LED notification light.

"8215","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I had recently had HSN Samsung Dart Deal and I didn't like the features not that the fact that I was paying for 4G service and the Dart was only 3G. Now with the Samsung Exhibit II 4G you can really see a huge difference. Much better Smart Phone and it's not running the old Android OS 2.2.2 Froyo like the Dart is but this one is Android OS 2.3.5 Gingerbread. Switching over to this phone was a piece of cake. Call T-mobile from the Dart and gave them the IEMI # off the box of the Exhibit II. Ended that call remove the SIM card from the DART into the EXHIBIT II. Added 16GB Class (4) MicroSD card at the same time. That's it.

This way if you ever need to pay the T-Mobile Corporate Store a visit you can. Right now even since when this one was first release I've had it since 11/11 it's still has it's moments. Takes sharp pictures with the back camera which has a flash. I've done skype with better than I've hope. Game play is okay the screen is only 3.7"" but sure better than my old dart was at 3.2"". Would be nice if T-Mobile gave us some more higher end phone choices but not to take us to the cleaners to do so.4G the phone stands out from the rest. This is a really good phone to get. Seems to be sold out a lot in Retail, so that's why I had to get it off Amazon back then.","990","Samsung","8"
"8216","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","Let me start this off by saying I'm not someone whom normally writes reviews on Amazon as when I buy stuff, it's generally things that people aren't on the fence about. However, I decided to go ahead and write a review to strongly recommend that you consider the Samsung Exhibit II from T-Mobile. When I read the PR from T-mobile about this phone, I got really excited that finally a GOOD smartphone was coming to the prepaid lineup at a reasonable price. I placed my order the day the phone came out and received my order on November 4.Screen Quality --- I think the specs are not quite as good as some of the top of the line models, but they're incredibly sharp and pretty dang close. It's incredibly clear and leaps and bounds better from the earlier android and iphone screens. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. Text is smooth and crisp.Phone calls --- Sound quality is excellent and sounds like a landline using T-Mobiles free wi-fi calling app. It integrates seamlessly with the phone and elects to use Wi-fi if a good signal is available. If not, it'll switch to the cellular network. There are no apps to install on the device or on your computer/router. Like I said, very seamless. Also, phone calls over the cellular network sound excellent as well.Text Messages --- Typical Gingerbread text message interface. The phone comes with swype which I had never used before, but have since become accustomed to and am thrilled it came preloaded on the phone.Memory --- The memory is a bit shallow. The specs say it has 4 GBs of memory though I have about 1 GB of USB storage and 1 GB of onboard memory. I don't know where the rest is though it could be used by the Android OS. Honestly, I would consider it a non-issue since you can get a Name brand Class 4 32GB microSDHC relatively inexpensively. I certainly have the option to upgrade the memory at anytime. Also, I have installed every app I can think of that friends have/use as well as several Amazon free apps of the day and I've used under 1/3 of the 1 gb system memory available. With the Amazon Cloud music player, it makes the total storage on your droid phone a non-issue since Amazon lets you upload unlimited music to their cloud for free. Then, you can stream it to your phone for free. So, I could have 200 GBs of music on my Amazon Cloud and this phone could play it all perfectly without the need for tons of onboard memory. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, there are several free radio Apps that I found on Amazon that are free and stream thousands of stations.Battery --- I've been getting about 15 hours of usage out of the phone and keep in mind, this is my first smartphone so it's still fun to play with. I don't have the screen brightness maxed out, but it's definitely bright and good enough. Also, the nice thing about buying a non-Apple device is that it has a user-replaceable battery. I found a generic replacement from Amazon relatively inexpensively. So, after a year of charging and uncharging when the battery begins to age, I can buy a new one and it'll be good as new.Overall, this is a great phone for the price. It's honestly not as snappy as a top of the line, dual core smartphone, but you're also not paying the price of that new phone either. It's still fast enough to handle every application I've run on it. But, I do have several widgets and services running so I know that I'm taking up ram and CPU power doing that.","990","Samsung","8"

"8246","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I bought 3 of these and they are great phones. I used one prepaid T-Mobile card on each one as they were purchased, then I unlocked it and signed up with PureTalkUSA. Unlocking was completely painless (which is the main reason I bought a 3rd one). Now I have unlimited talk and text plus a second account for a total outgo of about $40 a month. I really like the Android operating system and the phone is tough and attractive. It's a bit small if you don't have good eyesight and at times my big hands miss the icon I'm aiming at.All I have installed is the Amazon Store app and Amazon mp3 player, Opera Mobile browser, NQ Mobile security and an improved file manager. I installed SanDisk 32GB SD cards in both phones; just pop them in and boot.The only real downside is the bloatware. Sometimes I fill the memory and most of it is bloatware. Clicking the NQ Optimizer button clears enough memory to continue using the phone, but shutting down the bloatware does no good; these useless apps just start back up. If this problem was just a little less severe I would just live with it, but it looks like I will have to root all three of these phones. The bloatware just doesn't leave enough memory for the average users needed apps.Update: I have now unlocked and rooted this phone; both operations are simplistic if approached correctly. Unlocking is a snap and rooting only has one pitfall. Don't try to root with the one click applications; I tried that way and after several attempts overseen by the software authors (and installing a lot of java ME libraries on my laptop) we all gave up. The easy way can be found documented on theunlockr dot com site. The biggest gotcha is that clockwork mod must be installed *first* (cwm.6012.t679.zip). If you do that and then install root (root-stock.zip) you are rooted. NOTE: reboot as soon as you are rooted and then run a root checking program (there is a good one available here on Amazon (Root Analyzer). For about $7 you can then purchase Root Explorer and upgrade Superuser to Superuser Elite and download Root App Delete on Google Play. Root App Delete is a great application for uninstalling bloatware; the apps are listed as Unknowns (user installed or bundled popular apps) which can be safely uninstalled; operating system apps and kernel modules are listed as such (leave them alone, NOTOUCH etc.). I also run RAM Control Extreme; note that this app needs to be configured not to kill things while you are using them, but when configured properly it will clean things up in the background without even bothering you (I configured it to run every 30 min.). I suppose these modifications carry some risk, but nothing bad has happened to me and I see lots of similar testimonials out there.With about 2 hours work I was rooted and another hour of uninstalling and my memory stays about 49% used if controlled by a good Android Ram Manager (was as much as 90+ percent used before and most of it bloatware). The phone boots faster and runs faster and the changes are transparent. I lost no functionality. Better yet I can now use apps which require root access.With a little work and a little additional expense I now have a phone that cost about $200 that is (at least) equal to the $600 ""Unlocked International version""). With a pocketful of sims I can use this phone anywhere in the world. This phone is a great buy compared to the price of competitors. Recommended.Update: I have flashed my personal T679 with Cyanogenmod and like this phone even better. I overclocked it to 1024 MHz (stock is a little under 300) and after about a week I hit the right combination of hot temperature and working the phone to cause it to hang once. I dropped it back to 806 MHz and after 3 weeks still no problems and I work this phone as hard as some people work their tablets. The obvious tradeoff is that the battery drains faster with it overclocked. For me that isn't a problem; I have chargers everywhere (desk, pickup, bed stand, etc.) and I work it most of the time plugged in. I am a little rough on my phones no doubt in the same sense a racer is rough on his wheels but that's what I bought it for.Cyanogenmod also has much better memory control built in. It is just about perfect for me now; liking it better all the time. Glad I bought these phones. Recommended.","990","Samsung","8"

I have been hunting for a long time for a cheap but usable Android phone (i.e at least 1 ghz).

Touch screen is quite responsive except for small buttons sometimes.-Battery life is more than a day. (moderate wifi and calls connected to 2g only)(no 3g available here)-Camera is quite fine for random pictures, barcode scanner etc and includes a handy LED flash.-Includes a power saving mode which can be enabled at set battery percentages.-As usual, all the quality features of Android 2.3. (Hope to upgrade to cyanogenmod 9 or official 4.0 in the future)Cons:-The power/sleep button is on the right side of the phone. This can take some getting used to.For $200, you just cant go wrong","990","Samsung","8"

"8255","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","I bought this phone after reading so many good reviews. Unfortunately the one I received did not live up to those good reviews. So here is how it went for me:1. The plastic packaging on the phone was partly cut open when I received it. Since the phone looked brand new, I didn't think it was a problem and just went ahead and used it (opened the cardboard box). I never cut into any plastic to open it. Nothing else in the package was opened or touched as far as I could tell.2. The phone is not able to code it's own number into the SIM. So when you go to the phone status and check your own number, it simple says ""Unknown"". After spending hours searching for a solution on my own, contacting t-mobile support through chat and phone as well as going to a t-mobile store, the issue was never resolved. Their ""solutions"" ranged from wait and see to ""it can't be done"" and often contradicted each other as well. This seems to be a common issue with many t-mobile phones and the solutions ""vary"", none of which worked for me. Anyone can search the t-mobile support forum and I suggest doing that before buying a phone.3. The phone froze a few times. Initially I could hold the power button down to get it to reboot, but later only removing the battery would solve the problem. That's just unacceptable. T-mobile knows of this problem as well: [..]They blame 3rd party apps and lack of phone maintenance (rebooting). Well, I never installed any apps and I rebooted the phone far more often than I would have liked (several times a day to try and solve the above problem). It is loaded with bloatware, far far more than my Gio and my guess would be that is the reason for freeze-ups.4. The battery seems to drain very quickly and not unless I put it into constant power saving mode could it last a whole day. The first day I had it, I had to charge it 3x to keep it going after charging it fully to start with. I never even used up the entire $3.34 that is given as a starter credit, so making a ton of calls is not what used up the battery.I have a Samsung Gio that has never frozen up and the battery lasts for a couple of days even before needed a recharge. I put the t-mobile SIM it in and it could not code the number into it either. It has in the past coded numbers into other SIMs so I know it is capable of it. When I told t-mobile support this, he they told me that the Gio is not capable to code SIMs. I told him it can and does other ones just fine. He just went silent. I think T-Mobile's SIM is either defective or their methodology for over the air updates has some issues.I've returned the Exhibit II and will not buy another one. While the T-mobile staff are friendly and willing to help (almost all), it was mostly just a waste of my time. Good luck to anyone taking a gamble on it.","990","Samsung","8"

So, I requested a replacement phone, stating the first was defective. The second phone, was better, but was still slow, and at times would stop making/receiving calls and texts, and needing to be rebooted.

But given at $200 you probably can't ask for more.","990","Samsung","8"
"8261","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","*** UPDATE ***T-Mobile updated the firmware on this phone to Android 2.3.6. The difference is huge! My review below reflects on my experience using Android 2.3.5. Most of the issues have been resolved. While the phone still lacks memory, it manages it much better now. Instead of running out of memory and crashing all the time, the phone will now close unused applications before that happens. It also feels much snappier overall. For some reason though, the phone had somewhat better reception using the old firmware, taking off a star.*** END UPDATE ***The Samsung Exhibit II 4G could be a real game changer for prepaid phones. Unlike almost every prepaid phone out there, it has a high resolution 480x800 screen, runs Android 2.3.5 and has a fast 1GHz processor. Alas, Samsung did not want this phone to become a viable alternative to its far more expensive Galaxy S line and equipped this phone with not enough memory to truly give you all the benefits of a smart phone.First off, there are many things to like. The screen is bright with vibrant colors and crisp text thanks to its higher resolution. The included 3MP camera makes great pictures, comparable to regular 3MP cameras back when they were popular. I especially like that the phone does not compress the pictures too much like many other phones, leaving the pictures largely free of visible artifacts. I had a 5MP Nokia with Zeiss optics, but the pictures on this 3MP phone look WAY better. The reception is also excellent, even in difficult locations, such as on the Staten Island Ferry. This phone does not lose signal for the duration of the trip, unlike some other phones. Don't expect good data connection though when the signal is poor. Finally, you can use this phone with any T-Mobile sim card. T-Mobile offers discounted plans if you don't require a subsidized phone. This prepaid version costs much less than MSRP but will still work with your existing T-Mobile sim card.Sadly, the phone also has some major drawbacks, the biggest one being a lack of RAM. The phone advertises 512MB of RAM, but only 356MB are accessible. Preloaded and system apps take up the bulk of available memory, leaving you with about 100MB of available RAM, give or take, at any given time. If you like apps, that's not enough. Many apps, including the most popular ones like words with friends, install services that run in the background. They can use easily 6-40MB each. Download 4 Zynga games and you are out of RAM. Once the phone runs out of RAM, it slows down and crashes. Forget multi-tasking. The app widget which lets you close applications and free RAM will become your best friend.You could root this phone and remove some useless T-Mobile apps to free up some RAM but that would void your warranty and probably not help a whole lot. If the phone had 1GB of RAM, it would have been perfect.Overall, this can be a great phone if you want a smart phone but do not plan on installing many apps. If you want a phone that can truly take advantage of a high resolution screen and a snappy processor, this one is not it.","990","Samsung","8"

"8265","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","This phone was my first experience with Android. It certainly has lots of bells and whistles. And it certainly is a much better phone in terms of hardware and software than the iPhone. However, I returned this phone within 4 days of having it for a number of reasons:1) I need a phone that is reliable, durable, and functional for traveling. This phone does not do that. It has only 3G service in North America and some parts of South America. It does not have 3G service in Europe, Asia, or Africa.2) The phone is nowhere near as durable as a Blackberry. Not even close. Though it is much more durable than an iPhone. Unless you are in the habit of replacing your phone every 6 months because a new trinket catches your eye, this phone will not last 3 years of use and abuse. The screen will crack, the camera will scratch, etc. Nothing new here that iPhone users will not be accustomed to.3) With a fully charged battery, I left the phone on idle with it only connected to the 3G network for cellular phone service (no data). The battery was dead in 18 hours. Totally dead. I can leave my Blackberry in the same configuration for 10 days without any worries. This battery issue alone is enough to disqualify this phone for serious use.4) It is basically impossible to sync Outlook with the Android contacts/calendar. The only way is to sync Outlook with GMail servers, and then sync that with Android. This means that you must be ok with allowing Google to have access to all your contacts, calendar, and whatever else you are syncing. I think this is a huge breech of privacy.As far as I can see, this is probably the best Android phone on the market in terms of size, usability, price, etc. But like the iPhone, it is simply not ready for serious users. Just a toy.","990","Samsung","8"

Also, I was under the impression that I could get the $30 unlimited text and web with 100 mins. I was wrong. That card is ONLY available if you bought the phone through walmart. So now I have to do the $50 one, or only have 30 GB of internet. Other than those two, I love the phone and would recommend it.

"8270","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","For the price, this is a fairly decent phone. I switched from Blackberry, so I miss the physical keyboard, and small size of my BB.Size: As Android phones go, this phone is one of the smaller ones. It is almost the exact same size as the iphone, and even has a larger screen than the iphone. Screen size to phone size ratio is among the best around.Weight: AverageSpeed: Web browsing is fast. The phone sometimes takes 3-4 seconds to load the page with my corporate email - seems like a long time when you are staring at the screen. Other than that it seems ok.Battery: Terrible. But as I understand, all newer phones are like that - wish they would take a page from Blackberry and get a clueInternal memory: I've downloaded a few apps and seem to have more than enough memory left.Software: Phone installed an update the second day I had it, so it runs Gingerbread. It came with all sorts of preloaded software I don't want, but since I seem to have plenty of memory left on the phone I'm not worried about it.Other: You have to download stuff and tweak settings to get it to do what you want, and it does not always comply. I'm usually quite technically adept, but I set this thing to receive push email, and now for some reason it is not downloading new emails from my gmail. So there is some setting messed up. It is not like a blackberry, where everything just worked, but I think that is Android, not this particular phone.Accessories: Phone did not come with a memory card, but has alot of internal memory. Came with a USB cable and with a very nice (very small) wall charger, and a SIM card.Delivery: Took Amazon 5 business days to get the thing out of their warehouse - it just kept stating status was ""shipping soon."" But once it shipped, it arrived in less than 18 hours.7/21 EDIT TO ADD: I am using this prepaid phone on a regular post paid TMobile plan, and it works just fine. Just put in my own SIM card, called TMob and asked them to change my plan from Blackberry to regular data (no cost difference on my plan), and it works. This was the least expensive option for me; TMob wanted $329 to buy the phone outright from them; Amazon was $189.Edit 7/21: Have had the phone a little over 2 weeks now. Battery life is MUCH better if you physically turn off the device each time you are done using it - press button on upper right side. I was not used to having to do this, as my Blackberry either turned itself off, or somehow did not use as much power. Physically turning it off, I can get through a day on the battery. Part of saving battery life is setting display brightness to about 5%, screen time out to 1 min, and touch key light to 6 seconds. The 5% brightness is more than sufficient inside, but I cannot see the screen when outside. Will have to find an app that adjusts brightness when outside. Also, this particular android model has no LED light, so the phone lacks the visual notification that there is a new email or voice mail (ie like the BB blinking light). I solved that by downloading an app called ""NoLED"" which is terrific, and even shows the time on the screen. I'm getting used to the size of the phone; it is not as much of a problem as I anticipated, but still larger than my BB Pearl. Other issues are all Android issues, but I'm getting used to them or solving them. Gmail problem is solved, and a free app called ""SMS Unread"" can be downloaded and configured to show the number of unread emails in each gmail account.Update 12/22: At the five month mark, I'm reasonably satisfied with this phone. Biggest complaint about this phone is it's ridiculously terrible battery life. I think this a shortcoming of non-Blackberry phones (ie all Android & Iphones) and not this specific phone. A colleague who went from Blackberry to Iphone has the same problem. As a result of the poor battery life, my screen is set to the absolute lowest brightness, so I can't see anything on the phone when in the car or outside (anything subject to natural light), which is the second worst thing about the phone. I probably use less than 45 minutes a day of cell, and check it occasionally; battery really should last longer and allow for brighter screen setting so it can be seen in a car. Third on list of gripes is that it is not as fast as my friends Iphone5, but it is not a $700 phone either. I'll keep the $520 I saved and wait a few seconds for the phone to respond to certain commands. I'm told this is because the memory is filling up; I'd like a way to get rid of all the preloaded programs for which I have no use. Rooting will do this, but the root procedure for this model supposedly breaks it's ability to call 911, so I'm not interested in that.On the ok side, the picture quality is better than my BB, not stellar, but not bad enough to change phones. Seems lately to have developed a problem connecting via USB to the computer to download pics, but that might be Android, not this model of phone. I've also had an issue where I try to dial a number and it immediately disconnects. I pull the battery and let it restart and everything works fine. I don't know if this is caused by the phone, the OS or Tmobile.On the plus side, I've dropped it numerous times and the screen does NOT crack like iphones do. I find this one of the major advantages. The other advantage that I LOVE is the TMo Wifi calling - as long as I have a wifi connection, the cell part of the phone makes and receives calls regardless of the strength of cell coverage. Third advantage (silver lining in the cloud?) is that even though it does not have a hard keyboard (which I miss), it comes preloaded with ""swype"" for entering your text/numbers. This works pretty well, and makes entering text bearable, and apparently a feature like this does not come preloaded on iphones, because a few iphone users have marveled at this feature. I have no issues with sound quality on the cell, both regular and on speaker phone, and internet connection seems to work at a nice clip. Web pages are displayed crisply, so screen resolution is good.Overall, I'm pleased with the phone and pleased with the price.","990","Samsung","8"

It's my first smart phone, so I'm not speaking with tons of experience.There is a bunch of bloatware on this phone. I installed the ZergRush root:(...)And then Titanium Back-up app which allows backing-up to the SD card and removal of all the crap.Worked great. Still exploring all the capabilities this phone has.The voice recognition seems to work really well. I've used it a few times with the Google search function when I didn't feel like typing.It has locked-up once while surfing the web which required a battery pull. Re-booted with no ill-effects.A primary attraction to this phone was the availability of T-mobile's $30/mo 100 min/unlimited text and data plan. I wanted a smart phone on a monthly plan, but not the typical $70/mo charge you've got with a contract. For me, this is an ideal package as I'm not a big talker.That being said, read the fine print. This plan is only available via Walmart and T-mobile.com. The catch is that going through either of these sources makes it difficult or impossible to port your old number.To activate my phone, I called T-mobile's porting resolution number at 877-789-3106. They activated my phone and ported my old number, but then despite my request, set me up with the $50/mo unlimited plan. I had to call customer service and do some arm twisting to get on the ""Walmart plan"".In hindsight, it may have been easier to have paid an extra 10 bucks and bought the phone from Walmart.8/8/2012 UPDATE:This sucker runs HOT. Gets pretty warm while websurfing and streaming. Gets scalding hot while running Navigation. It's locked up a few times while running navigation. Pretty much the worst time to have to shut down and restart your phone (while driving).This last time when trying to restart, I got a message stating the battery was too hot, or something to that effect. I've started removing the case when using the Navigation.I'm pretty sure these symptoms are leading up to premature battery failure. Time will tell. Might try a different case to alleviate the issue.Other than that, I'm really happy with the phone.7/22/14 UPDATE:Final update. I dumped this phone about 6 months ago. It began to crash, restart and just plain shut down indiscriminately. Part of the problem may have been the SD card, it just didn't have the processing power to handle anything but the simplest apps. Biggest offender might be the latest Facebook updates. Any GPS app also will freeze it up instantly. My wife still has her phone of the same model, and we're getting ready to dump it too for the same issues.This model it just plain obsolete in 2014, and I would not recommend purchasing one at any price. It worked marginally well for the first six months, but after that, it became a turd.The good news is my new Moto X works awesome and I was able to seamlessly transfer my $30/mo 4G plan.","990","Samsung","8"
"8274","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","I bought this phone about six months ago. I decided to wait until I have used it for a while so that I can report on my success stories. Unfortunately, the phone stopped accepting or making calls about a month ago. After spending about an hour on the phone (another phone) with TMobile and then an hour with Samsung , I was permitted to send the phone to Samsung for repairs. After about 3.5 weeks, I received my phone, and it has not been fixed. I just got off the phone with Samsung again, and I am on my way to send the phone back to Samsung again. I hope that this time either they really really fix it, or they would replace it. In the meantime, I will probably be without the use of my phone for another 3-4 weeks.Update,After four separate repair cycles, and a three month delay, Samsung decided not to repair the unit anymore and send me a replacement. Unfortunately, the replacement is an older used phone, which was probably returned by another customer due to its own set of defects. I am now watching the phone anxiously to discover the defects of this phone, two of which I have already discovered.Needless to say, I am not happy with the purchase of this phone.Final UpdateThe so called working replacement from Samsung died five months later.

"8275","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","The Samsung Exhibit II is a solid and attractive upgrade phone for pre-paid users. Like many, I started out using a low-end LG Optimus V on Virgin Mobile, but soon tired of the slow data and bloatware of the phone. Looking around T-Mobile's Monthly 4G plans were 5 dollars cheaper and twice the data cap (2.5GB versus 5GB before throttling kicks in). HSPA+ was also amazingly fast - at least 3x the average speed of VM's 3G. But the problem was that T-Mobile's 4G Phones are pricey, even for the up-front cost that pre-paid users expect to shell out to get to a new phone. Looking around, I discovered Amazon was selling them for much less. The reviews seemed pretty positive, so I took the plunge and was glad I did. Although many of us dream of picking up a top of the line HTC or Samsung Galaxy, this phone was a big upgrade to my older OV. A larger and higher-resolution screen, much more responsive just in terms of scrolling and launching apps, and I wasn't constantly watching my disk space when loading apps because of the generous 4GB onboard storage. I did add an 8GB MicroSD so I could easily carry around my music and videos. Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase - I just wish there were more accessory options for it like a good Otterbox case and clip, but for under USD200, you can't beat this phone as a good mid-range Android.","990","Samsung","8"

However the tons of bloatware is annoying and it quickly drains the battery. As mentioned in other reviews the phone has to be rooted in order to uninstall the bloatware. Fortunately I found the following tutorial online on how to root the phone:[...]Once you root the phone you will need to use the android market app(already installed on the phone) to download the ""titanium backup"" app. I used this to remove all of the garbage from the phone. Now the battery lasts much longer and I can more easily find the apps that I do use.","990","Samsung","8"

I was maxing out the storage capacity with apps and photos on the Exhibit 4G, even though I used an SD card, it started getting a little glitchy and needing me to frequently clear cache, etc. So, I gave the Exhibit to my 13 yr old daughter who appreciates the front facing camera and is satisfied with it for texting and social apps, watching video, etc., all on Wi-Fi, as she has no data plan. Then, it got stolen from her and because it offers a lot for the price, we replaced it with the same phone (purchased on Amazon). I sure am glad I didn't spend more for her phone because she has since dropped it and cracked the screen. Fortunately, the crack isn't that bad and the phone still works great.

I even had to replace the battery because it melted and blew-up in the phone, Long story short: don't buy this. There are other phones out there that are of a better quality and that provide more bang for your buck. Also, do your utmost not to have T-Mobile as a carrier.

I put the Simple Mobile Sim card and it accepted it perfectly. I had to manually set up the APN (which is very easy and Simple Mobile explains how to do on their website). I was also able to successfully root the phone using the ZergRush method. After rooting the phone I installed Titanium Backup to remove all of T-Mobile's bloatware from the stock ROM.Since I am using Simple Mobile's $40 2g/3g plan I disabled the 4G to double the battery life.The phone itself is very snappy and the images are very crisp. The front camera works great with Google+ and Skype so you should be able to video chat without any problems. The rear camera could be better since it only has 3.2 MP but with the help of a good camera app you can add filters and enhance the pictures.It is definitely the best 4G T-Mobile or Simple Mobile phone you can buy for under $200.","990","Samsung","8"

This no-contract phone at $190 (Amazon price on May 26 2012) is a great buy for the features it has.I bought this for my 12 year old as an upgrade to her non-smartphone and she's loving it. Has loaded bunches of games on it and hasn't had any trouble with any of them after about 10 days.The suggested retail for the Exhibit II is $330. At that price, it's actually a very poor value considering the Samsung GNex is now going for $400.Compared to the $150 (Amazon price) T-Mobile Prism, the Exhibit II is a far better phone.Jan 14 2013 edit: There is a Samsung Android update for this phone that rebrands the phone ""Galaxy Exhibit 4G"" (maybe some improvements/fixes in there too but I didn't look into the update). After nearly a year, the phone still works fine but she occasionally (maybe twice a month) experiences the homescreen icons vanishing (no lockups or crashes that I'm aware of) which is fixed by a reboot. The Galaxy Nexus (GNex) I mentioned in the 3rd paragraph is no longer available and has been replaced by the top of the line Nexus 4 at $299 (8Gb) or $349 (16Gb).Apr 3 2013 edit: Still operating fine with the notations from Jan 14 but I'm deducting 1 star because the ""value"" of the phone has gone down as it ages while the price remains pretty stable. The dual core LG Optimus L9 is now available with better specs at nearly the same price.

So far so good. Easy. There is no cel service in my rural setting but the wifi at home works and was easy to set up the phone to automatically use the wpa-2 network, and now at home it defaults to the wifi for all functions like texting, calls, web surfing, etc. Very easy and so far so good. The phone is also responsive and has not crashed in the 4 hours I've used it. It's my first smartphone, and was easy to get into. From the reviews I had thought for sure that I would have to root the phone and all that, just to get the thing working smoothly, but it is fine. I'm liking it a lot, and look forward to seeing how the tmobile service performs, how the battery holds up, how well it works as a camera and media device with the microsd card I will install, etc. I do have to say that the price seems right for what you get here, since it has so much functionality in one unit and the droid OS seems pretty cool.

Its gorgeous to me. Very lightweight. There are lots of cases available for it to be customized how you want.

"8322","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","I've had this phone about a month, now. All the other reviews are spot on as far as specs go. I really don't have much to add, except that this phone is just bogged down with bloatware like crazy (the only reason I rated it 4 stars). So very tempted to root this phone.For those of you who are frustrated with this phone, give it a few weeks for the system to learn your habits. The first few days I had this phone, I was a little frustrated that the battery life sucked and it had various lagging issues. But as time went on, it got better with how it ran and the battery life improved quite a bit. It would be even BETTER once rooted.So the only downfall to this phone is its bloatware. It's not right to have admin rights restricted to the point where the user cannot get rid of what's lagging the phone. The manufacturers make these phones with certain specs- specs which are minimized due to the bloatware installed on these phones that make them perform at a subpar level.I only hesitate rooting because of warranty reasons. Murphy's Law, you know?But that's probably my only gripe about this phone. It causes it to lag and I'm oh so close to rooting it.Other than that, the pricing was great and to have a phone with Android interface? Awesome. I love that I can sync it to my tablet and my calendars can be updated with all my various scheduling things, regardless of where I edit it (phone or tablet). It's nice to finally have the apps that I had on my tablet, on my phone, which is on the go with me more often. Navigation, email, social networking, etc. All those fun bells and whistles that come with a smart phone. I also love having the capability to turn on wifi, which helps reserve 4G data so I don't go over the 2gb cap that I have.To top it off, I bought this phone in order to get a Value Plan at T-Mobile (inexpensive plans, but you have to buy your own phone). If you're wondering if that's doable, it IS. Less than 60 a month and I get all the services needed for a smart phone, plus insurance, plus MORE minutes than my previous plan, which works great for me. It actually comes out to a little less than what I was paying before for non smart phone internet.If anyone wants an entry level Android phone on a budget, this is the way to go. It has all the same bells and whistles as the 500-600 dollar phones (ex: Like the Galaxy S II) because they're all running the same UI. Just be patient and understand why this phone can be prone to lagging. The phone itself is awesome, it's just the junk that T-Mobile installs on the phone that makes it lag.","990","Samsung","8"

A bit longer with all power saving on, but not much.The screen goes dark 2 - 5 seconds after you dial. Thats a real problem if you call a answering system. Hard to ""press 3 for customer service"" if there is no visible 3 on the screen. This is a real bad bug. I am constantly having to push a button to ""wake up"" the screen. Of course, doing that puts me back to the main screen and I may or may not have lost the call. So, in terms of useability, this goes dim/goes dark bug (which you can not prevent from happening - I called about it) means I can not recommend this phone.I turned off auto sync (to save battery) and to my chagrin learned that unless its on, your g-mail inbox doesn't check for new mail. Nowhere did I see that warning, nor did it ask me ""do you want to check for new e-mail now?"". Reminds me of software from 1998!!!There is this blank screen (screen saver?) that covers the icons after a couple of seconds too. So once the screen goes dark, pushing the on button doesn't even return you to where you were before it decided 3 seconds is long enough for you to be inactive.The swiping needs work too. Sometimes response is slow; as in you push a button or swipe (to scroll) and nothing happens for several seconds. If you don't wait (and forget about aubible feedback!) you can scroll right past where you want to go.The screen edges are less sensitive and I often have to repeatedly swipe or press to get any response. While in other cases I swipe but the phone interprets it as me clicking on a icon and up pops some app or another. Not cool. Its almost like they haven't learned anything about user interfacing from the Macs and PC business.Two other things and I'm done.The off button is on the opposite edge from the sound volume rocker. This extremely poor design means if you hold it in one hand and push/squeeze it off chances are you also changed the ring volume. really poor design.Finally, I've tried four 3.5 mm headphone sets (wired) and none work with this. There are no impedance specifications listed, nor was customer service able to help. Its ridiculous. SO either I need to get a more modern pair of ear phones or the unit is defective. But come on! no impedance data for the headphone jack?!?!BTW best work-around for the screen going dark when you need access to the keypad is to set the phone on ""speaker"" phone. The Samsung forum is much more useful than Technical service = non responsive.To sum up: I don't have any other smart phone to compare this with but I hear power is a problem on many of them. The GUI (user interface) is slick but crippled: I have no doubt that in a couple of years the phones will work like you excpect a phone to work, without roadblocks and frustrations. I blame the newness of the technology rather than Samsung &/or Android. I am itching to try an iPhone though...its hard to believe they are all this bad...who knows.","990","Samsung","8"
"8326","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","Initially I was turned off by the very poor battery life, even after turning off wifi, GPS and Bluetooth and putting the screen brightness to the lowest setting. I was also disappointed at the sluggishness of the phone, plus how it would freeze not infrequently. I was thinking of returning the phone at that time.However, after spending LOTS of time trying to figure out how to root the phone, and finally accomplishing this, the phone really does seem to work like a charm. After googling ""how to root Samsung Exhibit 2"" and reading the top several matches, I got frustrated that I could not seem to find the right Samsung driver or download Zerg Rush Root. But after scrolling to the next page of matches, I found an entry on ""Samsung Exhibit 2"" in Wikipedia. The directions under ""rooting"" worked like a charm for me. They had the Samsung device driver for download, as well as Zerg Rush. It took me a little while to figure out how to download Winzip (I used the free ""evaluation"" version), which I needed to ""extract"" the Zerg Rush zip file. But after I figured that out, turned my phone to USB debugging, and plugged it into my computer, the phone automatically went into root mode (I saw a DOS screen pop up, giving the status of the rooting), and about 5 minutes later, the phone was all rooted! I then downloaded ""Titanium Backup"" (you first have to tell your phone to allow apps from non-Android marketplace), went to ""backup/ restore"" and deleted the unwanted apps.The battery life has increased tremendously since rooting the phone, deleting the junk apps and also installing Juice Defender. I leave wifi on all the time, and 14 hours later, the battery still has 77% life left in it. Before this, the battery would be nearly empty by this point. I even bought extra charging cords to have in the office and in the car, but it looks like I won't be needing these too much now. I can now wait to charge the phone when I get home.Unfortunately, one day after I rooted the phone, I am not able to find the link above to paste into this review. I went to Wikipedia and did not find anything under ""Samsung Exhibit 2"", nor could I retrace my steps and google my way to it. Sorry about that. But good luck trying to root your phone. It was worth the effort and frustration on my end, although just barely.","990","Samsung","8"
"8327","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","Like so many other reviewers, I bought this specifically for the Wal-Mart $30 plan that gives you 100 Minutes, but 5GB of 4G data and unlimited txts. Specifically, I bought this cheaper phone as a test bed to see if I *could* get the $30 plan, if 4G works well in my area and how easily I can run VOIP solutions to overcome the 100 minute limitation. If all works out, I will then buy the nicer Galaxy S2, which I already have on Sprint and sell this one. I will then port my old number via Google Voice to have my original cell number, which I've had for several years on this phone. I will probably not port the number directly to T-Mobile just to avoid headaches.Anyhow, I chose to purchase this off Amazon for the lack of sales tax, Prime shipping and easy return policy (if needed).I've had the phone for a few hours and, being Android-savvy, can declare that it's a very nice, basic Android phone. My current S2 still runs Gingerbread 2.3.5 and I refuse to go up to 3.0 or 4.0. Seeing as how the Exhibit still has 2.3.5, this works well for me.My biggest question was whether I was going to be able to get the $30 Wal-Mart plan at all. Other reviewers said it was pretty easy (don't call in to cust support, do everything online), so I bought the phone. During activation, which you should do in front of your computer, you will be presented with all the T-Mobile prepaid plans, including the $30 Wal-Mart special. As long as this is a NEW activation, that plan will present itself. It did for me, I signed up for it, paid the $30 and off I went. I have a new number, which I quite like actually, but that will be a moot point later on down the road.I am now working on the $30 plan with zero issues. 4G is indeed in my area and is working inside my house. It is very fast and a world of difference over Sprint 3G. Yes, Sprint has 4G, but not for 75 miles from my house.Anyhow, the Exhibit is simply a smaller version of the Galaxy S2, as far as I'm concerned. The screen is smaller, the phone is slightly slower in all aspects, but it's still a great phone. If you are not a power user, the Exhibit is all you need. It is very much simply the Galaxy's little brother.I will perform several additions/edits to this review over the next couple of days. There hasn't been a good, detailed, more-than-two-sentence review on this phone since mid-2012, so I wanted to interject a detailed, recent review here in 2013.In summary, if you want a functional, solid Android phone and you want the 5GB of 4G data and you want it for a measly $30, then this is the one to get. No questions asked. If you want a more powerful phone, get the Galaxy S2. THAT phone doesn't currently appear to be available on Amazon, but it is still available.","990","Samsung","8"

It has also been dropped in water ( I mean literaly submerged) in the tub and NOTHING on that phone quit working. This was my first Droid phone and I would recommend it to anyone. My co worker had a LG and when it was dropped in water her camera quit working, but on the Exhibit, no issues. The only complaint is that T-Mobile needs a little better coverage but other than that, I loved the phone it's self. It was so easy to use that my 5 year old daughter had her on app page and could change the settings herself to adjust to her games. Excellent phone","990","Samsung","8"
"8336","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","So this will never be a high-end device like a Galaxy S3 or an iPhone.But it's also hundreds of dollars cheaper. You only get Gingerbread (Android 2.3.6), 2GB of storage, and 512MB of RAM, but with the MicroSD slot you can add plenty more storage. It's common enough that aftermarket ROMs are available, so you can root it and add some new features if you so desire.The screen resolution is amazing given the small physical size; lots of phones with larger screens run the same resolution as this one. Colors are very vibrant, though like all AMOLED screens it's a pain to read in the sun.It doesn't have tons of processor power, but for the usual uses of smartphones (maps, web browsing, etc.) it has plenty. It's also surprisingly durable; I've abused mine pretty badly with no ill effects.Four stars for two reasons: one, no auto-brightness. Annoying, but you can long-press the status bar and slide your finger to change the brightness on the fly (phone has to be unlocked). Two, the wi-fi sometimes cuts out for 10-15 seconds every 30 minutes or so. Minorly annoying for normal use but drops VoIP calls. This has been an issue since the phone came out a year ago and still hasn't been fixed in the firmware. Besides those two minor annoyances it's an excellent low-mid range phone.As for T-Mobile, whether their service works for you or not is particular to where you live, work, and travel. All I'll mention here is that not having a contract is awesome (especially on the $30/100min/5GB plan) and that this phone does support T-Mobile's wifi calling (or VoIP, obviously) if you spend a fair amount of time in places with wifi but no cell signal.","990","Samsung","8"
"8337","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","The Samsung Exhibit II 4G phone I purchased from Amazon is great. I've had it for just over a month. It's my first smartphone and my first Android OS, but I'm liking almost everything about it. Great call quality and connectivity (important to me!), fast, good battery life, fairly intuitive to use (with modest learning curve). Can do free video calls using Skype when I'm in a wi-fi hotspot, and the call/video quality is good. The camera doesn't take great pics, but it's not an important feature for me. I had to download a couple of apps (keyboard and messaging) to overcome a couple of minor defects in the OS, but it was painless and free. I would recommend this phone to new smartphone users. But don't expect it to do everything! It's under $200! :-)","990","Samsung","8"
"8338","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I got this phone and was really pleased with the overall fit, finish, and feel. It was sleek and not overly flashy. The screen was bright and crystal clear. I did alot of research on T-mobile and coverage areas. On the map, I was covered, and 100% covered by 4G, so I was excited to try it out. I got the phone overnighted from amazon and got it all set up and nothing... No signal and the phone stayed in ""Edge"" data, but couldn't even get on the internet. I could make calls, but not recieve them. I called T-mobile and they said everything was fine, and made a test call, which came through. That was the only call that ever made it through... EVER! So, sadly, the phone went back, and I stayed with Sprint.","990","Samsung","8"
"8339","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I just got the delivery of this phone yesterday, and it took me about 12 mins to set it going.... and yeah, it fully qualifies for the $30 (100 mins + unlimited text and data with 4G speeds for 5GB)... at least it worked for me! I just followed the instructions mentioned in the starter kit and chose this plan on the site. And yes, I bought the phone from Amazon.I have used iPhone 3G in the past, and this one definitely outsmarts the iPhone 3G for sure. I haven't checked out on iPhone4 as yet. But who needs an iPhone4 when most of the features come at one forth of the cost. And, without any contract!The phone is pretty zippy even with a 1Ghz single core processor... definitely not as zippy as Galaxy S2 Skyrocket which runs on a dual-core 1.5 Ghz. Having said that, I am only comparing. The phone is quite fast really!Gingerbread 2.3.5 is simply amazing! There are virtually unlimited Apps available. Samsung TouchWiz UI is very good and intuitive. I love the swipe left/right for message/call feature. Very basic, but so useful!As mentioned by other reviewers, there is quite some bloatware pre-installed on the phone, that one cannot remove (as of now). But, it is definitely not a factor to reject the phone. Some people might just find these useful as well.I haven't connected the phone to my PC as yet and shall update a line or two on the same in some days.I have ordered 32 Gigs of micro sd and will let know how it goes. Per some other reviews, it worked out well.I had charged the battery to full last afternoon and have been doing quite a lot of wi-fi, downloads et all, and yet it has about 28% left. This is where the Exhibit II beats the Skyrocket hands down. The Skyrocket is a battery-drainer, of course due to its larger screen and bigger processor.I am glad that I bought this phone over Galaxy S2, and I would definitely recommend it to someone who does not need a super computer on-the-go and wants to have a decent smartphone with no contract.More updates soon!Update 1 (01/28): Exactly a month's usage, and I am more than happy to have bought this phone. It doubles up as a very decent music player with 32 gigs memory. I would suggest downloading PowerAMP and good in-ear head-phones (J5 JBuds from JLabs is what I use.. they 're neat).On the down side, at times the phone is a bit sluggish when unlocking the phone with pass code. Not that bad since its not that frequent. Also, I don't really use Kies Air to manage and transfer music. I find it ok to use, but am more comfortable just dragging and dropping music folders onto the phone.I have installed quite a number of Apps and all of them have worked excellently on the phone.The voice quality is good, the 4G coverage is very good, at the least in my neighborhood and my work place. Since I have the $30 unlimited data package with first 5GB at 4G, I never really use wi-fi. I guess it improves the battery performance further. I have disabled the 'Background Data' in accounts and sync under settings. I check my emails manually when needed.All in all, I am quite happy with my purchase so far, and I expect it to service me for about 18 months to 2 years at the least.","990","Samsung","8"
"8340","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","After using this phone for a week, I'm favorably impressed. I wanted a small form factor to slip into my pocket. I wanted a removable battery. I wanted to be able to add extra storage. And I wanted to own a smart phone outright without a 2-year contract. I was able to cut our monthly cell phone bill in half for our 2-phone family. This phone has it all! I had been an apple ios5 user, and I'm still keeping my ipad, but I have to admit that this Android OS (gingerbread) is very good. My wife's iphone 4 almost seems old, heavy and clunky next to this. Yes, the phone is plastic and probably won't withstand a hard drop, but neither did the iphone. The rounded corners make it easy to slip into pockets, and if you are worried about it slipping out, buy a silicone cover. I had been a t-mobile user, but I whole-heartedly concur with other reviewers.... t-mo customer service reeks!

(yeah I did charge it to 100% first.) I registered this thing at Samsung's web site and was shocked to see it only left the factory line 9 days before it was shipped! These arent some warehouse clearance specials, they are brand-new.I tested the 4G where it was available, and it was darn close to 2MBps, faster than my home DSL. I upped my TMobile plan and am looking forward to trying the wireless hotspot. There was no advertising or announcement that TMobile was rolling out 4G here in Central Florida. It works a lot of the main areas, not out in the boonies where I live...Great phone, Android Gingerbread waaaaay faster than Froyo...camera takes great pics, the built-in media player is nice w headphones. Could have come with a better ringtone and wallpaper assortment. The Google Maps GPS gets me in my yard to about a foot of real-life. Sweet.The included data cable didn't allow it to self-install drivers in Windows 7 64-bit, so I downloaded the Samsung New PC Studio (yeah that's what they call it) and then was able to browse the phone and add stuff to my SD card. I got a 32GB one somewhere at 32 bucks...so now I got me a touch-screen Gingerbread MP3 player..that has a 4G phone built in!! for like 170 bucks less than the 32BG IPod.

"8344","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","1","After less than 1 month of using this phone, we experienced texting issues - essentially texts wouldn't send & we'd get a failure message. A call to T Mobile customer service had us going through all kinds of hoops trying to diagnose the issue & finally the CS just told us to switch our SIM card. We did & the phone worked well for about 1 week. We are now back to texting issues & unable to receive/make phone call issues where we have to power down the phone, wait & power it up again.However, upon looking at the message boards on the T Mobile website, I learned that other people have this same issue & T Mobile has acknowledged the issue, but has not resolved it.<<This is a known issue with this device. Putting the phone on GSM only, as mike_s stated, is a workaround. We ask that you please be patient with us as we work with Samsung to come up with a resolution.>>The T Mobile workaround:I have found a few things that can help you text in the meantime. First, I'd look to uninstall any texting applications that were used during the failures, and if the texts aren't very long, it might help to not allow the phone to switch between 2G/3G networks. This can be done like this; 1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key. 2. Tap Settings. 3. Tap Wireless and Networks. 4. Tap Mobile Networks. 5. Tap Network mode. 6. Tap GSM Only. While it isn't ideal to keep your phone on GSM only (as browsing speeds will be slower and you will need to manually change the network back to get faster data speeds) we have found that short texts on GSM only rarely fail. I hope this temporary workaround finds you well, and know that we will continue to work on this.T-ForcePersonally, I think that patience can only last so long. Apparently, T Mobile has known about this issue since November but has done nothing to fix it nor have they offered a replacement phone to unsatisfied buyers.We really liked this phone, but it is simply unusable if it doesn't allow a user to text. From 5 stars to 1 star.3/8/12: Phone still has texting issues & T-Mobile has done nothing to rectify the issue. You can never tell if the phone's recipient actually received your text & we are still experiencing bouts of text sending failure. We are switching to the Lumia 710 & giving up on this phone. Disappointing. What a waste of money.ORIGINAL POST (LOVED THE PHONE):We are on a T-Mobile family plan & it was time to bring my spouse into the world of smartphones. Since he is hard on his phones, I didn't want to spend a lot of money, but wanted him to have access to email, maps & the other benefits that smartphones provide.The Samsung Exhibit II is an impressive little phone. It is easy to pick up & start using right off the bat. It has swype capability, voice texting & an easy to use/read calendar (voice capability to add an ""event""). There are a ton of nice features packed into this phone & it costs less than half of the ""fancier"" smartphones on the market.We purchased a soft silicone case to start Black Soft Silicone Skin Case Cover for Samsung Exhibit 4G T759 & it fits fine; however, when a more durable case comes available, we will probably upgrade.","990","Samsung","8"

DOES NOT need to be bought from walmart/T-Mobile .. I bought mine here .I've looked every where for a clear answer but I always received mixed answers so am making it clear here . Just be sure to activate online .. I'm not sure if it works over the phone also .the battery is ok .. most android phones battery aren't that great but this one lasts me a day easily with moderate use.I haven't experienced any lag mainly because the specs are rather the same as a top notch phone of its era .Yes there's tons of bloatware but rooting it allows you to get rid of that very easily .I wish the camera was at least a 5mp but for the price 3.2mp with flash is decent enough and gets the job done.It takes getting used to using the keyboard (probably just me because I come from using physical keyboard phones) but after a while its not an issueOverall I'm very happy with this phone and does everything I need it to do .. 100 minutes for the plan I have isn't a lot but using groove IP and google voice fixes that issue . Also with the $30 4G plan its hard to compete against that :]","990","Samsung","8"

"8354","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","I didn't really buy this phone for its calling features. I wanted a low-cost, pocket-sized device for email, web browsing, and remote control applications.Music playback was expected, but not essential. After looking around, it came down to the Exhibit II and the iPod Touch. I chose the Samsung partly because I didn't want to carry around two devices (phone+web). It was a tough choice. I really like the 8GB Touch. Had Apple included 16GB on that device I might have bought it instead.The first phone I received from Amazon was defective. It would lock up after a short time. My replacement works fine. Amazon made the process easy. I had never returned items to Amazon; I'm impressed at the speed and the ease they provided. After my first Exhibit II failed I was depressed. The replacement arrived quickly, so I had only a few days to mope.If you're thinking of upgrading your prepaid ""feature"" phone to this T-Mobile/Samsung smartphone, you might wonder if you can use your existing by-the-minute voice plan. Yes, you can. But web access is limited to when you're near a wi-fi spot. That's how I'm doing it. I recommend shopping T-Mobile's web site as opposed to visiting a store or signing up via phone call. If you buy this phone, you'll want to open a free GMail account for the best integration.As far as the hardware goes: it's excellent. The Exhibit II is solid and comfortable to hold. Plugging in over-the-ear headphones gives loud, clear sound. The 800 by 480 display is crisp. The touch response is good. Although adequate, the earpiece (speaker) could be louder. It is hard to hear your caller in a noisy environment. When used moderately over the course of a day, this phone needs to be charged daily.Factor in time required to purge bloatware from this phone. I rooted my phone (free) and installed Titanium Backup Pro (seven dollars). One shouldn't have to do that. It takes hours to research, plus time and (small) risk in rooting the phone. It appears that rooting is easiest done via Windows computer. [Edit, 19-Apr-2012: I installed a ROM called CyanogenMod9, or CM9 to my phone. This unofficial (and beta) OS is based on Android ICS ""ice cream sandwich"" OS. Despite being incomplete, CM9 for the Exhibit II is very capable and feature-laden.] Although the phone has a slot for a microSD card, the package does not include one. You should definitely purchase a microSD card if you plan to install a custom ROM.I hesitate to recommend this Exhibit II to someone who doesn't want to go to the trouble of purging junk software -- look elsewhere. Now that I've eliminated bloatware, I feel very good about this phone.","990","Samsung","8"
"8355","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","This is a great phone, and it's really amazing what they can make at this price point. The screen is not as nice as more expensive phones, but it is fine. There is 512 MB RAM, much of which is already used up by the system, so you have to be careful not to run too much at once. Overall, everything seems very well designed.Tmobile does include some amount of bloatware on the phone. The phone can be rooted very easily, and I would suggest using a free app off the Marketplace to freeze system apps which you don't want. It is not terribly hard to recover the phone to stock if you manage to screw something up.The phone comes locked to Tmobile (you have to purchase an unlock code online, or have a very nice CS rep unlock it for you). More importantly, it does not support 3G data in Europe, which is a big downer for those who travel outside the US (voice and Edge data should still work).","990","Samsung","8"

"8386","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","I've had this phone for over a year, it works good and has a great sharp screen. It doesn't have much horse power at only 512MB of Ram and a 1.0 single-core processor, and it struggles to have more than one or two apps running at a time. At times it freezes and you have to force-close some apps. That being said though, it does work quite well for most situations.It has a really good clear speaker, I'm actually really impressed and how great it sounds while playing music. The voice quality is good, not great. If you're not much of a techie or power user, this is a good phone at a fair price. If you're looking for something that can handle a lot of apps, and that is really responsive, I'd look for at least a dual-core phone with 1GB of RAM.I should note that I did root this phone and put a custom rom on it, so that may have caused some of my responsiveness issues.

Unusable out of the box, transformed into a very nice phone thanks to devs, CM10 and other jelly bean based roms. No longer have it but had fun rooting and loading different roms back in 2010-11. Will always remember this little guy. Loved high res LCD 800x480 on 3.7"" is still very nice today. My new 4.5"" has lower ppi than this. Everything looks vibrant and nice. 3MP camera is better than other 3MP in its class for stills and video. I was excited to use the front cam with skype. Was my first smart phone with the front cam. VGA but still useful. Removable back cover, replaceable battery, if that matters. Takes standard size sim. Runs different GPS apps, almost never had gps issues.My only complaint the ringer is very quiet, compared to other phones i've head by Nokia and LG. The volume rocker is very soft. I often accidentally pressed it with my fingers. Out of the box needs to be rooted, debloated, custom-rommed, app2sd a must due to low internal memory.

The phone specs looked very respectable for the price point. I wanted PAYG so I wasn't tied into a contract that would last longer then my stay in the US.When the phone arrived, it was very easy to set up. The instructions are very clear. I had it registered and activated on the network even before the battery finished charging. Within a day I had received an over the air update of the Android operating system to Gingerbread. It would be nice to get Ice Cream Sandwich or Jellybean on this handset, but for the price point that is probably wishful thinking.Still it is a good phone. 4G speeds are very good.

The touchscreen is sometimes slow to respond and it freezes constantly. I hate the droid emoticons, they scare me, those ugly booger looking things! Also I came to notice that T-mobile smartphones come with a lot of bloatware, apps that come pre-installed & I can't delete eventhough I have no use for them, which sucks very badly, shame on you T-Mobile.

"8429","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I had an iphone 3g for a few years. But I had tmobile and the 2g speeds were maddening. So I went to the android side and got this phone because I did not want to spend a lot, but wanted 4g speed. I got that.Physical size is same as the iphone. Screen is fine. Those that say it doesn't view well in the sun, make sure your brightness is turned up. Mine defaulted to the lowest setting and it took me a month to figure out that was the problem.Phone is light. Responsive. Call quality is good. 4g speeds are great, though sometimes I lose a signal, but I think that's not the phone as I live in a dead spot.Transition to Android was entertaining. Not the closed system of Apple, so there is some funkiness that I liken to the PC world, though not that crazy. Rooted the phone to get rid of a lot of bloatware, and I highly recommend you do that.Changed the theme to look like an iphone as I mentally have committed certain icons to certain functions.Battery life is fairly good. I can usually go a couple of days without charging and I use my phone a fair amount.When I was in the tmobile store, I drooled over the Galaxy S2. But in the end, I have an ipad, so why do I need a galaxy. This phone was cheap and highly functional.My only minor complaint is the lack of a better ""on"" button, as the power button on the side of the unit is a little hard to depress at times to wake up the phone. But I can live with that.All in all, I think this is a great 4g android phone for less than $200. Hard to go wrong.Ironically, I tried to buy this at the local tmobile store in my town to support local business. But because of the challenges the carriers have with previous contracts and lots of small print rules governing the prices of phones, the best they could do was $350. Hello amazon.","990","Samsung","8"
"8430","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","I've owned this phone for more than one month and in general I'm quite satisfied by its performance.Pros:1. Price. For $200 you get the experience similar with those flagships 1-year ago (Samsung GS I with a smaller screen), and more importantly, with the 2.3.5 OS.2. Rootable. It could be very easily rooted by using the same protocol for the 1st gen. Ppl really shouldn't complain about bloatware anymore but did a little research on this.3. $30 unlimited data plan. If you get covered by the T-Mobile 4G then it's a steal to get 5Gb 4G speed+free text and some free minutes (100). Time to forget about those basic smartphone plans cost $70 pre-tax elsewhere.Cons:1. CPU. Single core 1G is simply not enough to run the OS smoothly when 4-6 apps are running in the background. I have three email apps (Gmail, regular email app and Hotmail) and a newsfeed actively synchronizing in the background and the phone usually takes 0.5s to turn on the screen after pressing the power button and another 2-3s to make screens switch smoothly. One tweak is turning off the screen animation to get better response. Soft video decoding is also poor and frame-skipping happens quite often even when the bitrate is less than 500kbps.2. Battery. With 4G data and background synchronizing only (Wifi, BT, GPS all off), the battery can last about 30 hours in idle. In daily use you may have to charge it every night.Overall:Based on its performance/price, it definitely should be considered as a top prepaid phone with a perfectly matched plan.","990","Samsung","8"
"8431","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","4","I have had the phone for about a month now. I must say that going from a ""dumber"" phone to this has been a life changing experience and I will never go back to a non-smart phone. The phone itself is really quite nice, it is the perfect size (not to big, not to small) but like many have commented, very slippery! Getting a case for it is a must. As noted, it does come with some bloatware that is preinstalled and the only way to get rid of some of the applications (like media social, etc) is to root the phone (this gives you administrative rights - for the brave just google ""rooting samsung exhibit II"" and you will be able to find the means to do so).Since many reviewers have described the positive aspects of the phone, I wanted to point out that not all is rosy with T-mobile's pre-paid 100min, free text, free web plan. I was dismayed to find out that I was not able to use Google Voice as the default voicemail for the phone, nor was I able to use T-mobile's own preinstalled visual voicemail --- I can see the business logic behind these moves (T-mobile does not want pre-paid customers to have easy ways to get around using the limited 100 minutes while checking voicemail (google voice and visual voicemail use data instead of minutes)....still, I feel that T-mobile has mislead customers (they have nothing on their website that states that going pre-paid ""limits"" some of the features vs. what subscribing clients have access to).Still, it's not a bad deal overall - just annoying that they treat pre-paid customers like 2nd rate clients.","990","Samsung","8"

I live in the zone where 4G supposed to be great. (4G or 2G) My husband has Optimus (3g) still and get his e-mails where i don't with 2 phones sitting side by side. My text messages don't get sent.

"8435","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","This is my first smart phone and I was lured in by the reasonable price and T-Mobile's new $30 unlimited text, unlimited data, 100 minutes plan. I simply could not justify the expense of phone and data before. I think this phone is great value for $200. It has almost every feature I want. The only thing I would have really liked would be a 5mp camera like on the Galaxy S. I handled a Galaxy S and was considering buying a refurbished one of those for $150 more before deciding on the Exhibit II. I don't regret saving the money. Unless you've had a higher quality phone before, or you're comparing this side-by-side with something higher end, you won't feel limited or cheated by this phone. It's got a very crisp vibrant display, runs quick and smooth, and even with the 3.2mp camera I've taken some decent photos. Sure beats my previous phone anyway. Battery easily lasts me from 6am to late in the night. I haven't had it actually die on me yet. I don't know how my usage might compare to others, but I use Facebook and email frequently throughout the day, have tried out the GPS navigation a couple of times, used Google Music, surfed a bit of news, and played Words With Friends. The display is the biggest battery drain I think, so I keep that down pretty low all the time. I don't do much talking, hence getting the plan with only 100 minutes, so I can't say how much battery is affected by talk time.Only a couple of gripes... As others have mentioned, the beep when the battery is charged is annoying. I charge my phone by my bed at night and I still want to be able to receive emergency calls and texts so I'm not going to put it on silent in order to avoid that beep. But it does wake me up. Still, I can live with it.Sometimes texts fail to send and I've seen other people in forums with this problem too. Also the texting app is glitchy and doesn't always respond to your taps in the text area to bring up the keyboard.Yes, the back cover is as slippery as everyone else says. I bought the gel skin case for the Galaxy W (same phone as the Exhibit II, just rebranded outside the US) and I'm so glad I did. I would certainly have dropped the phone repeatedly by now if I didn't have the skin.Overall, I highly recommend this phone. Excellent price for $200, especially if you're been holding out for a while for the price of smart phones and data plans to drop.","990","Samsung","8"
"8436","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","5","Solid performance on a great network. Had to call to port my old number. The process was done the next morning before noon. As for the phone it just works. It handles the newest apps and games without any issue. Some may wish for a ""vanilla"" android experience but after using a phone like that i find Samsungs Touchwiz interface a nice improvement. I could re hash all the good stuff about this phone but for that you can read the other reviews. As for issues, which i may be alone on. I find the internal memory partitioning to be confusing at best. Theres a main system partition of 1 gig then a second 2 gig partion called usb memory. Thats all well and good but most apps that dont have custom save settings dont have a selection for it. I use an external memory card but this space seems a little odd. It seems like they wanted to give you some protected memory for music i guess its kind of odd. please comment if you know whats up with it. On to other things.The phone is as slippery as everyone says and with curved edges i never take it out without a death grip on it. Its more than just slick plastic. that textured back is like wrapping a hockey puck in nylon, and the phone is very light.The antennas seem to be in the base of the phone. i can sit in my living room and hold the top of the phone and get 4 bars on a 4g tower. Then hold around the bottome it will drop to the point that it switches to edge. Outside this is not an issue so no worries, its just a little odd.And last up the network.Tmobile is pretty solid where i live which is funny because they dont even have phone numbers around here. I ported mine so no worries. The customer service is top notch, heck if i didnt have to port my old number i wouldnt have had to talk to anyone.Thanks Samsung, Amazon, and T-mobile","990","Samsung","8"

Second, the navigation is terrible. It is difficult to see how to exit from certain function such as messaging, contact lists or the phone pad. Finding settings is difficult too..still can't find the auto-word-complete for sending messages. Beware signing up an existing Gmail account. It totally loads the entire gmail contact list and mixes it in with your phone list. Suddenly, you might have hundreds of contact names. I tried to delete the GMAIL account, but it require an entire phone reset.My other phone is an iPhone, which I find to be superior, so, I've obviously experience a higher standard.","990","Samsung","8"
"8444","Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679","119.99","2","Background: I am not a techie, just a regular person. Previously owned the T-Mobile G2 for about 2 years. I just bought the Samsung Exhibit last week just to have a more up-to-date phone. I loved the slide-out keyboard and durability of the G2 (seriously I don't know how many times I dropped it and it never cracked. I was trying to decide between the Nokia Lumia 521 and this one, and ended up getting the Exhibit due to familiarity of the Android system. After a few days, I bought the Nokia due to a few issues.Samsung PROS:---Great interface---Great preloaded apps (I didn't even need to install some of the ones I was using before because the ones included were comparable)---Front-facing camera---Plastic backing made me feel uneasy, but I think it's safer in case of a drop---Small pocket-size---Sounds came through loud and clearSamsung CONS:---Grainy pictures---Back cover is a challenge to remove---EXTREMELY UNRESPONSIVE TOUCHSCREEN. My biggest issue thus far, leading me to purchase the Nokia. The screen will not register your touch or lag for minutes. And when you're trying to use the navigation in traffic, those minutes seem like hours. Having to tap the text box 5-6 times to bring up the keyboard and type messages was incredibly annoying. This is unforgivable though.Now that I have the phone, I really question all these 5-star reviews by what seems like professional reviewers...go to the Samsung site and you will see nothing but 1-star reviews of dissatisfaction. I think I'm going to keep the Nokia and send this one back.","990","Samsung","8"

"8462","Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - International Version, No Warranty (Titanium Silver)","593.5","1","The seller was good. They send me a sealed box. The problem is the phone. I bought it to use in Argentina. When I opened the phone in Argentina there was a pink line on the screen. It's a full pixel dead line across the screen. Y search on internet and it is a common problem with the edge phones and the solution is a new module/screen. There is no guaranty for me here.","864","Samsung","8"
"8463","Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - International Version, No Warranty (Titanium Silver)","593.5","5","This phone is absolutely amazing. I could go on about the class leading camera, the all-day battery life, the amazing screen, the unquestionably useful Always On Display. That's probably not the most impressive thing about this phone though. Think about an iPhone 6/6S/7 Plus. Now think of the most annoying problem with that phone. If you're like me then the most annoying problem is undoubtedly the ENORMOUS bezels on the side of the phone. For those of us who want a bigger screen (because it usually means more features/a better viewing experience) the iPhone is damn near impossible to hold in the hand because after the screen ends, there is a huge swath of space on the sides that add several critical millimeters to the width of the phone. Not with this phone. The curved display not only looks amazing, but serves to give the phone a very compact footprint for the 5.5"" screen you are getting.That being said, there are things I don't like. Samsung still needs to make their software more stable and less energy inefficient. The longevity is more a virtue of the large battery than the software. Additionally the software can sometimes have funny quirks. Nothing too bad, but just things that are a little weird or slow sometimes.I also recommend that you buy a case for this phone. More than anything else on the market it's a work of art and you'll want to preserve it. I personally recommend this: Spigen Thin Fit Galaxy S7 Edge Case with SF Coated Non Slip Matte Surface for Excellent Grip for Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge 2016 - Black. This case is thin and almost feels like it isn't there. It'll make your phone easier to grip and give you piece of mind while you're out all day with it.","864","Samsung","8"

"8493","Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - International Version, No Warranty (Titanium Silver)","593.5","1","It seems that most of these unlocked international version phones are unlocked by the sellers themselves, who break the phone's box seal, open the box, and unlock the phones themselves (note that Samsung says ""do not accept if seal is broken""). Hence, technically, most of these unlocked international version phones are not really new. I bought a lot of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phones from Amazon, and most (not all) had the seal broken.On the phone itself, interestingly, the S7 Edge feels lighter than the S7 (even though it is 3% heavier ... maybe because the weight is distributed differently). The bigger screen is good for people with vision issues, but the resolution is the same as with the S7. The edges are highly annoying, making one touch them by mistake constantly. Furthermore, the edges make it very difficult to properly protect the phone with a case. I do not like this phone. I love the regular S7.","864","Samsung","8"

"8506","Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - International Version, No Warranty (Titanium Silver)","593.5","5","I received this phone yesterday and instantly fell in love with it. I have owned several Galaxy phones (s3, s4, s4 active, and s5). So far I love it! It came sealed in the original box. I cannot use the charger adapter that came with it, but I expected that as it's an international version.I picked the gold color, it looks and feels elegant and sleek. I love the interface, the phone itself is super fast. The phone has a big, beautifully bright screen. I am still getting used to its size. The fingerprint scanner is noticeably better than that of the gs5. Both cameras take amazing pictures.I am one of those people that are constantly on their phones during most of the day. It has an excellent battery life and charges very fast.I did read a couple reviews where people complained about the phone slipping out of their hands. I have used an Otterbox Symmetry Series case since I took it out of the box and have not had that problem at all.My only complaint about this phone is that it does not have an IR blaster, but I can live with that.I will update my review in the future if anything changes.UPDATE:I have been using this phone for about a month now and it is still just as amazing as when I took it out of the box. It still has amazing battery life. I have a Pocket Juice power bank that I was using around noon every day with my Gs5 but I have not used it at all with this phone. It usually still has 15% after about 12 hours of use.I have not had any lagging or random restarts like I did with my Gs5. The phone is still amazingly fast and responsive.I have slightly tested the waterproofing of this phone. The fingerprint scanner does not work well when wet, but the touch screen is still responsive.I have a Otterbox Symmetry Series case that I use with this phone and I have noticed that it causes the Zagg Dry screen protector to bubble up around the edges (I would like to state that I did NOT allow the protector 24 hours to ""cure"" after applying before putting the case back on, so that could be the reason.) I have heard that with the edges it is hard to find a case/screen protector combination that doesn't cause bubbling at the edges.Overall I would definitely recommend this phone.","864","Samsung","8"

But i searched the problem up and its normal for it to occur the first day, its setting up anyways, first day of startup. Until now, I've had it for about 2 months. The S7 Edge, exceeds expectations.

"8573","Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - International Version, No Warranty (Titanium Silver)","593.5","5","This phone is by far one of the best on the market. After reading the reviews left by some of the buyers, there seems to be some confusion on what seller to buy it from. My phone, which is real, and came factory sealed, was bought from ""The Coos"". However, to my understanding, there is no one out there making fake edge phones. The phone is just too complex to duplicate. What might be happening is the phones could possibly be getting damaged during the shipping process. The phone is glass, so if the shipper isn't packaging it correctly, it could absolutely take on damage. This is why I recommend, that if you are planning on buying this phone from amazon, make sure amazon is the one fulfilling the order. I have had no problems at all when I order from a third party that allows amazon to fulfill the order. Also, it doesn't hurt to review the customer reviews on the actual seller as well.As far as the phone itself goes, it works perfectly. All the specs pretty much define what to expect from the phone. It's got the best screen in the world and the best camera. The glass finish makes it beautiful, but it's fingerprint prone and and extremely slippery. Other than that, I have no complaints.","864","Samsung","8"

With one charge it'll last me all day, while on the other phone I had to recharged it when I got home from work.The graphics are amazing and I haven't had any glitches or problems with the phone so far.I did buy a screen protector and phone case since I seem to break phones quite easy.The screen itself seems to be scratch resistant.As for water resistant I can't say anything since I haven't used my phone in the water, I don't feel confident enough to drop my phone in the water or have it in the shower.This is so far the best phone I've owned, it does not heat up as bad as my other phone and it has an elegant view.","864","Samsung","8"

"8609","Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - International Version, No Warranty (Titanium Silver)","593.5","5","Bought this specifically because I wanted the Exynos processor instead of the Snapdragon and so that I can root if I wanted to. I'm on T-Mobile US and did my research to ensure that my bands are supported - which they all are except for some 3G. I bought this phone from a seller named 'lifeline###' and the box the phone came in had the factory seal. As another reviewer pointed out, my phone originated from the United Arab Emirates so this came with a non-US friendly charge adapter and the manual appears to be in English & Arabic. In any case, the phone is great working order and I was able to just pop in my T-Mobile SIM card with no configuration needed, nor a visit to the T-Mobile store!I upgraded from a Galaxy S5 so all I had was the regular charging block which doesn't support the fast charge.

Since it is an unlocked device no one seems to want to take responsibility for repairing it under warranty. I am having the famous grey line problem which seems to be a pretty wide spread problem with this phone.Samsung customer service is terrible. I have spent hours trying to find a way to get my device serviced and keep getting told to call someone else or someone will call me back in 24 to 48 hours and no one ever calls back.For Samsung customer service alone I will not buy another Samsung device ever again.","864","Samsung","8"

"8703","Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - International Version, No Warranty (Titanium Silver)","593.5","5","Greatest phone ever.I have used it for 9 days already and it's awesome.My only complaint is the lack of good glass screen protectors.First off the camera,it's awesome,although it's pretty similar to the S6.I wish they stayed at 16mp as it was 16:9 but otherwise, its great.It even has a wider angle,when zooming it had a tiny bit better quality than the S6 and autofocus is extremely fast.Low light was obviously insaneThe battery, this was one of my main concern with my S6 and the S7E battery is very good.The first days which tend to be pretty bad for battery life, where surprisingly good.I even had to drain it's battery sometimes.But to be honest it perfomed a bit worse than I expected, i mean, it's waaay better than the S6,but as a student I thought it would last me a bit more.I read articles on people saying they used their phone heavily and ended the day at 11:30 with 20 percent battery life(that was using bluetooth,nfc,location and wifi/lte on as they said) and in my experience, I have finished days with 35% battery from 7am to 11pm but only using either wifi or mobile data,no bluetooth or nfc,no location services on.So I think mi phone's battery is stabilizing yet(if someone can tell me if im right say it please!).As a student, I don't use my phone for long periods from 7 to 4pm.Maybe 15 min intervals or 30 minutes using gallery for photos,what really surprised me is that battery drained pretty fast sometimes and sometimes it almost didn't drain,which is weird.That's why I think it may be normal for the fist weeks(again,correct me if i'm wrong)BTW, I don't use powersaving,which I did on the s6 alwaysPower wise, It's an extremely powerful phone which can manage literally anything,and there's no lag with power saving on or off.There's not much to say.The phone is a bit bigger than the s6 and s6 edge.I strongly recommend it","864","Samsung","8"

"8710","Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - International Version, No Warranty (Titanium Silver)","593.5","5","I bought the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge G935F in Black from this product page a week ago.A lot of people have asked questions about this particular international version so I'll answer some of those first. For starters, the one I got was the english edition for the Saudi Arabia market (see attached photos, the guides came in english and arabic). From what I can tell, the phone is the same as any other international edition but with different preinstalled apps. Mine came with a SA region specific app ""Shaid"" (seems to be a YouTube-esque app in arabic) that I uninstalled and WhatsApp. Other than that the only remaining bloatware was stock Samsung apps (no carrier apps, thank god), the only other thing I noticed that may be region specific is the S Planner app has a ""Hijri dates adjustment"" setting. Lastly this version ships with a non-us wall charger (aside from the regular stock accessories) shown in my review images. Mine also came with an adapter for use within the U.S., I have tried it and can confirm that it works with fast charging.This phone also uses a different chipset (manufactured by Samsung, called Exynos 8890) than the U.S. version. Reviews I read noted that the phone was actually optimized for this chipset w/ better performance and battery life than the U.S. Qualcomm counterpart (Google it). In the U.S. version the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip is used to support Verizon and Sprint customers whereas this version only supports GSM carriers.To preface the review of the actual use of the phone, I have owned the following devices and used them each as a daily driver for at least a months time: Samsung Galaxy S4 GPE, Samsung Galaxy S5, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, HTC One M8 GPE, iPhone 6, iPhone 6S, Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P. The Galaxy S7 Edge has been the most delightful experience of the bunch. I won't go into great detail here but the camera is phenomenal and launches faster than any other phone I've owned w/ a double tap of the home button. The camera's auto focus is super fast and I feel like I'm able to get a capture a lot of moments that my previous phones were too slow to shoot. It's also nice to be able to change the quick launch apps on the lock screen, I have the dialer and snapchat as mine.Continuing a theme of high performance this phone is incredibly fast despite powering a QHD resolution screen. Apps are surprisingly quick to load and multitasking is a breeze (I even found some use in the Samsung's split screen feature). The fingerprint scanner is on par with apple devices (and nexus 6p/5x) although because of it's non-circular shape I find that I place my finger the wrong way more often. The battery is the best of any device I've used as a daily driver, I've been able to get through days of heavy usage like today (unplugged from charger at 5:45am, now at 25% at 9:03pm).The screen is BEAUTIFUL. Not only is it easy to read even in direct sunlight (something I have seen other devices struggle with) but the colors are vibrant and the screen is huge without making the phone too big or bulky. Perfect for watching YouTube videos and browsing instagram.Lastly a few notes if you buy this phone:- If you're not a fan of the stock Samsung launcher you can get the Google Now launcher from the Play Store, it's the same one used on Nexus devices and feels smoother than Samsung's launcher.- This time around Samsung decided to give you bigger icons which drove me nuts, search for ""Get more on your Galaxy S7, S6 or Note 5 screen with hidden DPI scaling settings"" from Android authority to get a 5th column on the home screen and smaller UI elements.- ""Edge functionality"" is just okay. The feature feels a bit less than polished because of the weak offerings in the Samsung app store - I have it turned off.Edit 4/8/2016: sorry about the quality of the photos of the actual phone - they were shot with the wide angle lens of my GoPro whereas the other images were shot with the S7 Edge.Edit 4/10/2016: added some higher quality images from my new camera.Update 5/9/2016: I've been using the phone as a daily driver for over a month now. I'm still impressed by the overall gfx smoothness, how fast apps load, and camera performance.Update 7/25/2016: still in love with this phone. I'm honestly not sure what would compel me to purchase a new phone at this point.. I also rooted the phone and changed the emojis to the iOS 9 set with the Emoji Switcher app from the play store. No more guessing when messaging my iOS friends =)A lot of commenters have asked which seller I purchased mine from: Wireless Everything.","864","Samsung","8"

Phone would consistenly freeze (once a day) with the watch on. The only solution is restaring the phone. and the freezed clock is an extra because it made me lose a few meetings.3.)

"8740","Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - International Version, No Warranty (Titanium Silver)","593.5","5","My husband and I bought these as an upgrade from our previous Galaxy S5s. I got the rose gold and he got the black one. The rose gold color wasn't as rosy as I thought it would be, it's more of a champagne color. The black one looks very sophisticated and elegant. I must say that I was not a fan of Samsung borrowing Apple's idea of no memory storage and making it difficult to put the sim card in but it was an easy fix with being able to send all of my extra photos to my Samsung account. Upon arrival, the packaging makes sure the product is not harmed whatsoever (lots and lots of bubble wrap). In all honesty I was afraid the phone was not going to hold up very long because of the glass edge and because I'm prone to dropping my phone...a lot. However even with out a case it has held up quite well. The photo quality of the front and rear camera is amazing, definitely a step (or two) up from the S5. We decided to buy on amazon because the price listed was $200-$300 cheaper than buying in stores, plus free 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime. All in all I would highly reccommend this phone if you're a Samsung lover like myself.","864","Samsung","8"

Easy to transfer my data to the new phone, very thing and light, when i first held it i was like ""omg this thing is super light"" like i would drop it forgetting about the weight of it lol Only thing i was ""eh"" on about getting it was the seal was detached from the box(wasn't broken but the adhesive was rubbed off from shipping/warehouse), and the branding that usually says ""S7 Edge"" on the back is not on this model which i think is a good thing but made me feel for about an hour ""man i got a fake"" but it was not the case at all, it felt like the real deal. I checked the settings and the software is super snappy and easy to use, in the ""about phone"" section of settings it does say model number and the phone type as what it was advertised.PRO:~Amazing screen~Great build~Wireless Charging/Water Resistant(i have tried the water resistance and i say it works, had residue from the stickers and so i ran under tap water and cleaned that right off)(i have yet to try wireless charging yet)NEUTRAL:~Battery(it seems great but at the same time not so great. I woke up at 7am with 100% and then by 8:45am its at 85% so i still great but i feel by the end of the night ill have 10% left or less. I am a heavy user when it comes to my phone)CON:~Charger it comes with is foreign(my seller gave me an adapter with my phone, but i don't know if that's every purchase so be well aware it MAY NOT come with an American Adapter)As far as i can tell that's about it so far, i will update my review when and if anything changes. Yet to test wireless charging but plan on picking one up soon and will add an edit to this.","864","Samsung","8"

The big one for me was how hot the phone got. For just using google Maps, to even playing Pokemon go for a little bit in the park, the phone got so hot I could barely hold on to it. I couldn't even imagine using this with a case on it might melt. Then when the phone detects that it gets too hot then it makes that big beautiful display lowers it brightness to where I can not see in the daylight anymore. I am having a lot of issue with it in the Sun.I have heard of these issues with other Samsung phones. Maybe its just the ones with this certain processor, I am unsure if the SnapDragon ones have this issues but the reason I got the international is that it could go to any carrier more or less and I could get the added performance of the Exynos Processor. Turns out it was a bad idea and the phone got so unreasonably hot that I could barely hold on to it. The phone also got noticeably slower as it got hotter. Probably because the processor was limiting itself.Maybe this could be fixed with a software update but I think this is more of a hardware issue. Maybe I just got unlucky and got a defective phone as i don't see many other people mentioning these problems. I do not blame Samsung or have any bad feelings for them. I just got unlucky with my device and will be returning it to Amazon.","864","Samsung","8"

"8763","Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - International Version, No Warranty (Titanium Silver)","593.5","2","EDIT: So after owning this for a few months, I'm dropping the rating solely because of the Edge touch screen. The fact is that I find it very annoying to use. The side of your hand touches it really easily, and it it makes typing or playing games on the phone very frustrating. The edge apps themselves are very few and far between and not that useful either. It's a pity since the phone itself is great, runs programs well, has great visuals and camera but actually using the thing is just frustrating. I'd suggest getting just the S7 to save yourself some money and comfort.The phone that arrived is the genuine article and works great--I'm thrilled with how well the battery and fast charging works even when playing Pokemon Go all the time. Also, I have T-Mobile and the phone works perfectly fine.However, even though the app is on your phone, the international model is not compatible with Samsung Pay. If you want that you need to get the American version of the phone. I wish I'd known this, but to me it was worth the savings in price and you can still use Android Pay. But I didn't realize this before buying it and I would have liked to have known.","864","Samsung","8"

Purchased on June 10th 2016. 3 months later, the PHONE BRICKS. No damage, no spill, never even touched water, in a case its whole life. Just stops working, going on, nothing. Got extremely hot for about 2 hours for no reason after it went dead, but then nothing after that. Called Samsung (had registered the device and everything), first they collected info on the phone and said they will call back in 24 hours. Waited a week, no call. Called back and they straight up told me they will not help because Samsung America does not help Samsung Anywhere-else. They connected Amazon, and Amazon just dropped the phone on me in mid sentence with no call back! (And no number I can call them back). Return policy ends July 31st ONE MONTH+ after the order!!Basically if you buy this phone from here you will not be supported if anything goes wrong.... and my phone BRICKED with neither Samsung, Amazon or TheCoos stepping up to the plate to support or repair.

Another important feature is that you can still use this in the US and have the 4G compatibility, the only thing that you are going to miss it is the processor as the other US version has a better processor using the snapdragon 820.

"8851","Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - International Version, No Warranty (Titanium Silver)","593.5","5","I live in the UK, but had this delivered to a friend's address while I completed a road trip from Miami to San Francisco. The delivered product was well packaged and was originally intended for the Middle East market. A big bonus for me is that the supplied charger uses a UK-style 3-pin plug. While hardly a big deal as I, like most people, have the world's supply of USB power adapters. Considering that this purchase has saved me quite a bit of cash over outright purchase in the UK, I'm very happy.Powering up the phone for the first time shows a single application for the intended market which was deleted as I have no use for it. I've owned Android phones previously, but have been using an iPhone 6 Plus for the last year. I've since fallen out of love with iOS as it's just too inflexible and is becoming somewhat childish in terms of interface. Samsung's implementation of the Android platform is smooth, highly-polished and commendable. It's not as fast as the pure product in the Nexus lineup, but does not suffer as all as a result.The octacore processor in the non-US model is just pure sweeping power. It's a good thing that the battery is a hefty 3500mAh unit or it wouldn't last the day. That said, if you're the kind of user who has multiple applications running all day long - and I'm among that userbase - this phone will take it all in its stride and not break a sweat. The screen is absolutely beautiful without being too highly saturated, the cameras (both front and back) are immensely capable and the return of expandable storage through cheap and capacious micro-SD cards is very welcome.Physically, the phone is svelte, lightweight and sits in the hand beautifully. Even without a case, there's no feeling that you'll drop it at any moment. One of the finest physical features is the waterproofing that doesn't require that you slap chunks of rubber into the ports to maintain its integrity. no more panics when you're caught in that torrential downpour about your phone suffering a premature demise.I haven't tried any of the included accessories such as the micro-USB cable, charger or earbuds as I already have very high quality 3rd-party versions. From the look of them, they appear to be reasonable quality.For anyone in the US who's concerned about losing out on network connectivity by using a phone from an overseas market, rest assured. I used a SIM card linked to T-Mobile's 4G network and had absolutely no issue anywhere with obtaining a good strong 4G signal. The Exynos processor in the US market model, while likely perfectly adequate, will almost certainly be that touch slower than the beast in the overseas market product.If you're like me, fear running out of power when you're away out all day and carry a power bank, know that the quick charge 2 feature has this from about 5% to fully charged in around an hour. The genuine Samsung quick charge puck may be slower to re-add the juice, but it's utterly convenient when you're a tired and then don't have to worry about not quite plugging the phone in to charge.If you're seeking to buy a phone without the burden of a contract, do yourself a big favour: Save some money, get this model, use one of the probably five or six wall chargers you already have and enjoy this incredible handset. It may be coming from outside of the US, but it's delivered quickly and I have no doubt whatsoever that it'll be loved every bit as I love mine. This is the best phone I've ever had, and the added bonus of saving on the cost of purchasing outright through Best Buy, etc is the icing on an already very delicious cake.","864","Samsung","8"

Took it to my local AT&T store for the sim card and it took a little extra time and a couple of restarts, but after that everything is working great. I'm still learning some of the little tricks that come with it. The cell coverage shows ""4G"", not ""4GLTE"". I don't know the difference. The ATT guy said some would say it was better, LOL. I have no idea but, whatever. There are a few pre-installed samsung/google things. Smart Switch uploaded many things, but some things like ringtones were not backed up. I had to go looking for them. In the process, I also discovered some new ones. Battery is doing just fine and lasts as expected. It has it's own Samsung factory warranty - 1 year. I haven't been able to find any way to tell for sure if this is the snapdragon or xynos processor, but as I stated earlier, the model number matches, so....my first experience with an unlocked phone purchase on Amazon has gone well, IMHO.

"8867","Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - International Version, No Warranty (Titanium Silver)","593.5","4","I'm really liking this phone. To be fair this is my first flagship phone. I'm coming from a cheap Nokia Lumia 520 but figured for once I'd splurge and see what all the fuss is about on these top tier phones.The first thing I noticed is that the screen is absolutely beautiful. I couldn't get over how clear and lifelike everything looked. Also being able to actually see my phone's screen in the sun was a definite plus haha. OLED is just an awesome technology and I can't wait until TV manufacturers tweak the picture processing a bit. Just a great display.I haven't run benchmarks or anything but everything on the phone is very snappy. Going into the camera, opening/switching apps, playing games, watching movies, etc. all ran smoothly. I didn't notice any warmth or the phone running hot but that probably due to using a case. The call quality was fine and overall I'm really enjoying it.On the down side, I think the phone's a little awkward to hold or picking up from a flat surface. I got this case Galaxy S7 Edge Case, SUPCASE Full-body Rugged Holster Case WITHOUT Built-in Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (2016 Release), Unicorn Beetle PRO Series - Retail Package (Black/Black) and the rubber edges made a world of difference. It's no longer slippery and easy to pick up off of a flat surface. Nothing worse than paying for a phone like this only to drop it while trying to set it up!The only thing I'm hoping is that the battery lasts quite a long time. Not having easy access to it is kind of a bummer. As I just dropped nearly $750 on it and I don't upgrade phones every year I'm hoping it lasts awhile. As much as I really do like this phone I don't think I'll be spending this much on a phone again. The purchase was more to quell my curiosity about these high end phones so I can check that off my bucket list hahaI purchased the phone from Wireless Everything and it arrived brand new in a sealed box with all new components. I popped my SIM card in and I was off to the races. I never purchased an international phone so was a bit nervous but everything went extremely well. If you're looking for a cheaper alternative I would suggest the OnePlus3 or ZTE Axon 7. Very similar specs for 400 smackaroos.","864","Samsung","8"

"8874","Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - International Version, No Warranty (Titanium Silver)","593.5","1","The screen cracked completly with a fall on the ground when I was going up in a car. So it was not a big distance or fall. I used to have the S6 edge, and definitly had more falls and from much higher distances, and this never happened before. This was the first fall, and it breaked a lot. And after the minutes where passing, it where cracking more and more. I'm not living in the USA, so I had to fix the screen in my country, and the cost of a new screen was around 300 dollars. More than half of what the phone cost me. I can understand that if the phone fell from my pocket it's my fault, but what I don't understand is how fragile it is. Obviously, besides that, it's a great phone, but the fall was very light and the damage very strong.","864","Samsung","8"

I bought my Galaxy S7 Edge and paid full price for it less than 7 months ago. Now the phone is presenting a hardware problem which was already acknowledged by Samsung that it is a factory problem, what means, they know it is their problem and that they are supposed to get it fixed or exchanged. However, because it is an ""Unlocked International Version"", no Samsung authorized service would even touch the phone. Not even if I am paying for the service. So, now I have a USD 800 paper weight worth nothing at all. I hope Samsung is reading this. I have been a Samsung Loyal customer since Galaxy S II and now I am dropping this ""Loyalty"" for a Windows Phone (yeah, Windows Phone.

The AT&T employee told us that it was not unlocked or it would connect immediately. He even restarted it to double check. The Amazon representative who started the returns process gave us the name and phone number of the company that actually sold it. When we called that number, a Verizon automated service answered the phone. So my conclusion is that the phone must be locked to Verizon.

The biggest difference I noticed was the battery life lasts double what the last phone did. Plus, the screen is big. Can't go wrong with the Ultra HD resolution. The only problem I have with it is that it's the Italian version and won't let me use the Samsung Pay like my American S6 Edge did. Kind of a bummer, but we still live in a time where I have to lug my driver's license around, so my credit card might as well come along for the ride.","864","Samsung","8"

The battery life is great, since it lasts about a day with moderate to heavy use.Also, for those who are wondering, this model supports most LTE bands, and it is also supported by most GSM carriers.

"9005","Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - International Version, No Warranty (Titanium Silver)","593.5","4","I'm really liking this phone. To be fair this is my first flagship phone. I'm coming from a cheap Nokia Lumia 520 but figured for once I'd splurge and see what all the fuss is about on these top tier phones.The first thing I noticed is that the screen is absolutely beautiful. I couldn't get over how clear and lifelike everything looked. Also being able to actually see my phone's screen in the sun was a definite plus haha. OLED is just an awesome technology and I can't wait until TV manufacturers tweak the picture processing a bit. Just a great display.I haven't run benchmarks or anything but everything on the phone is very snappy. Going into the camera, opening/switching apps, playing games, watching movies, etc. all ran smoothly. I didn't notice any warmth or the phone running hot but that probably due to using a case. The call quality was fine and overall I'm really enjoying it.On the down side, I think the phone's a little awkward to hold or picking up from a flat surface. I got this case Galaxy S7 Edge Case, SUPCASE Full-body Rugged Holster Case WITHOUT Built-in Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (2016 Release), Unicorn Beetle PRO Series - Retail Package (Black/Black) and the rubber edges made a world of difference. It's no longer slippery and easy to pick up off of a flat surface. Nothing worse than paying for a phone like this only to drop it while trying to set it up!The only thing I'm hoping is that the battery lasts quite a long time. Not having easy access to it is kind of a bummer. As I just dropped nearly $750 on it and I don't upgrade phones every year I'm hoping it lasts awhile. As much as I really do like this phone I don't think I'll be spending this much on a phone again. The purchase was more to quell my curiosity about these high end phones so I can check that off my bucket list hahaI purchased the phone from Wireless Everything and it arrived brand new in a sealed box with all new components. I popped my SIM card in and I was off to the races. I never purchased an international phone so was a bit nervous but everything went extremely well. If you're looking for a cheaper alternative I would suggest the OnePlus3 or ZTE Axon 7. Very similar specs for 400 smackaroos.","864","Samsung","8"

Yes it can improve for example, the back cover would be great in aluminum (kinda like iphone) it'll prevent from cracking in minor accidents. The speakers can always be louder I guess.

I've been waiting for a update from Samsung on this matter but it seems like my phone was from Egypt and I have not received an update yet. Pretty much the phone has been unusable for me because I can't even type or navigate the phone without it closing me out of applications or opening up ones randomly. I am very disappointed in this.

"9040","Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - International Version, No Warranty (Titanium Silver)","593.5","5","I'm not one who generally uses my phone. I'm a pay-as-you-go type of person. I use my phone for calls and texts. I see no need to pay extra for internet with the number of places with free wifi. My last phone was the Samsung Gravity, so this was a large step for me. For my needs, this phone is extremely oversized... with that being said, the display size makes it great for other things. I try to use my phone minimally. I use apps for the weather because I own a convertible and love the beach. I also chat with some friends using LINE. I was holding out for the 64GB version, but didn't see any availability for it and needed the phone for work... so I can download and read email... and chat using Lync/Skype.PROS- 12 MP camera for nice crisp pics.- excellent display for viewing photos and movies- extremely fast and smooth opening and switching apps. I notice no lag whatsoever.- expandable storage- battery can last me two daysCONS- size- easy to accidentally press button on sides- internal memory options for the U.S.- color choices by cell phone carrierIf there is one regret, it's that I wish I had bought the dual sim version just in case I wanted two carriers so I can maintain my grandfathered price plan and still pay separately for wifi should I ever need it.","864","Samsung","8"

Came prepackaged, sealed, Turned on in English. There was an Arabic file of some sort - which I deleted. The model number matches correctly. No issues or problems getting it going and activated. Took it to my local AT&T store for the sim card and it took a little extra time and a couple of restarts, but after that everything is working great. I'm still learning some of the little tricks that come with it. The cell coverage shows ""4G"", not ""4GLTE"". I don't know the difference. The ATT guy said some would say it was better, LOL. I have no idea but, whatever. There are a few pre-installed samsung/google things. Smart Switch uploaded many things, but some things like ringtones were not backed up. I had to go looking for them. In the process, I also discovered some new ones. Battery is doing just fine and lasts as expected. It has it's own Samsung factory warranty - 1 year. I haven't been able to find any way to tell for sure if this is the snapdragon or xynos processor, but as I stated earlier, the model number matches, so....my first experience with an unlocked phone purchase on Amazon has gone well, IMHO.

"9149","Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - International Version, No Warranty (Titanium Silver)","593.5","5","I live in the UK, but had this delivered to a friend's address while I completed a road trip from Miami to San Francisco. The delivered product was well packaged and was originally intended for the Middle East market. A big bonus for me is that the supplied charger uses a UK-style 3-pin plug. While hardly a big deal as I, like most people, have the world's supply of USB power adapters. Considering that this purchase has saved me quite a bit of cash over outright purchase in the UK, I'm very happy.Powering up the phone for the first time shows a single application for the intended market which was deleted as I have no use for it. I've owned Android phones previously, but have been using an iPhone 6 Plus for the last year. I've since fallen out of love with iOS as it's just too inflexible and is becoming somewhat childish in terms of interface. Samsung's implementation of the Android platform is smooth, highly-polished and commendable. It's not as fast as the pure product in the Nexus lineup, but does not suffer as all as a result.The octacore processor in the non-US model is just pure sweeping power. It's a good thing that the battery is a hefty 3500mAh unit or it wouldn't last the day. That said, if you're the kind of user who has multiple applications running all day long - and I'm among that userbase - this phone will take it all in its stride and not break a sweat. The screen is absolutely beautiful without being too highly saturated, the cameras (both front and back) are immensely capable and the return of expandable storage through cheap and capacious micro-SD cards is very welcome.Physically, the phone is svelte, lightweight and sits in the hand beautifully. Even without a case, there's no feeling that you'll drop it at any moment. One of the finest physical features is the waterproofing that doesn't require that you slap chunks of rubber into the ports to maintain its integrity. no more panics when you're caught in that torrential downpour about your phone suffering a premature demise.I haven't tried any of the included accessories such as the micro-USB cable, charger or earbuds as I already have very high quality 3rd-party versions. From the look of them, they appear to be reasonable quality.For anyone in the US who's concerned about losing out on network connectivity by using a phone from an overseas market, rest assured. I used a SIM card linked to T-Mobile's 4G network and had absolutely no issue anywhere with obtaining a good strong 4G signal. The Exynos processor in the US market model, while likely perfectly adequate, will almost certainly be that touch slower than the beast in the overseas market product.If you're like me, fear running out of power when you're away out all day and carry a power bank, know that the quick charge 2 feature has this from about 5% to fully charged in around an hour. The genuine Samsung quick charge puck may be slower to re-add the juice, but it's utterly convenient when you're a tired and then don't have to worry about not quite plugging the phone in to charge.If you're seeking to buy a phone without the burden of a contract, do yourself a big favour: Save some money, get this model, use one of the probably five or six wall chargers you already have and enjoy this incredible handset. It may be coming from outside of the US, but it's delivered quickly and I have no doubt whatsoever that it'll be loved every bit as I love mine. This is the best phone I've ever had, and the added bonus of saving on the cost of purchasing outright through Best Buy, etc is the icing on an already very delicious cake.","864","Samsung","8"

"9151","Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - International Version, No Warranty (Titanium Silver)","593.5","5","Bought this specifically because I wanted the Exynos processor instead of the Snapdragon and so that I can root if I wanted to. I'm on T-Mobile US and did my research to ensure that my bands are supported - which they all are except for some 3G. I bought this phone from a seller named 'lifeline###' and the box the phone came in had the factory seal. As another reviewer pointed out, my phone originated from the United Arab Emirates so this came with a non-US friendly charge adapter and the manual appears to be in English & Arabic. In any case, the phone is great working order and I was able to just pop in my T-Mobile SIM card with no configuration needed, nor a visit to the T-Mobile store!I upgraded from a Galaxy S5 so all I had was the regular charging block which doesn't support the fast charge.

Got extremely hot for about 2 hours for no reason after it went dead, but then nothing after that. Called Samsung (had registered the device and everything), first they collected info on the phone and said they will call back in 24 hours. Waited a week, no call. Called back and they straight up told me they will not help because Samsung America does not help Samsung Anywhere-else. They connected Amazon, and Amazon just dropped the phone on me in mid sentence with no call back! (And no number I can call them back). Return policy ends July 31st ONE MONTH+ after the order!!Basically if you buy this phone from here you will not be supported if anything goes wrong.... and my phone BRICKED with neither Samsung, Amazon or TheCoos stepping up to the plate to support or repair.

No Carrier bloatware. Suspiciously missing the Galaxy S7 Edge logo on the back shown in the photo. Aida64 shows the correct info, though.I've used the phone for over a week, now. I'm very happy with it. Still getting used to some aspects of the interface, but what it does, it does incredibly quickly. No lag in anything. Samsung has some nice features included. I love the health suite. I love the battery life.Cons: the duplicate apps. I want the ability to remove the browser, email app, etc. Things that I don't use. Things that Google also includes. Can't uninstall those either, surprisingly. Also, the whole Edge thing... There aren't enough ways to customize it or the edge notifications which display with the always on display.

I was impressed that the phone was delivered sooner than expected. The box was sealed and everything was intact. My only problem is that this phone came with a plug you use in Europe and where I live we use the plugs used in the US. Not a big problem since I can charge the phone with other chargers. I bought the international version since I read that the Exynos chip is better than Snapdragon. I previously used a Samsung S3 which recently died and it wasn't a difficult transition. I also have a P8 Lite which in my opinion takes better selfies. I'd still buy the S7 edge again though. The phone is very fast. Battery life is exceptional. I have only charged it once so far and it still has 52% of battery life left! I also love that the phone is very loud. The phone fits easily in my small hands and is pretty light. I also love being able to unlock the phone with my fingerprint. I also love that the speaker is very loud. For someone who's hard of hearing like me that is a plus!","864","Samsung","8"

For some reason, my phone doesn't always recongnize my fingerprints. I've reset them a couple times and it still doesn't always read it correctly. My last three phones had fingerprint readers and they were all quicker or more accurate than the S7 Edge. I suspect that it's because the home button is very short (height-wise) and that the home button is raised.FEATURES FEATURES FEATURES","864","Samsung","8"

"9242","Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - International Version, No Warranty (Titanium Silver)","593.5","5","My husband and I bought these as an upgrade from our previous Galaxy S5s. I got the rose gold and he got the black one. The rose gold color wasn't as rosy as I thought it would be, it's more of a champagne color. The black one looks very sophisticated and elegant. I must say that I was not a fan of Samsung borrowing Apple's idea of no memory storage and making it difficult to put the sim card in but it was an easy fix with being able to send all of my extra photos to my Samsung account. Upon arrival, the packaging makes sure the product is not harmed whatsoever (lots and lots of bubble wrap). In all honesty I was afraid the phone was not going to hold up very long because of the glass edge and because I'm prone to dropping my phone...a lot. However even with out a case it has held up quite well. The photo quality of the front and rear camera is amazing, definitely a step (or two) up from the S5. We decided to buy on amazon because the price listed was $200-$300 cheaper than buying in stores, plus free 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime. All in all I would highly reccommend this phone if you're a Samsung lover like myself.","864","Samsung","8"

"9275","Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - International Version, No Warranty (Titanium Silver)","593.5","5","This phone is absolutely amazing. I could go on about the class leading camera, the all-day battery life, the amazing screen, the unquestionably useful Always On Display. That's probably not the most impressive thing about this phone though. Think about an iPhone 6/6S/7 Plus. Now think of the most annoying problem with that phone. If you're like me then the most annoying problem is undoubtedly the ENORMOUS bezels on the side of the phone. For those of us who want a bigger screen (because it usually means more features/a better viewing experience) the iPhone is damn near impossible to hold in the hand because after the screen ends, there is a huge swath of space on the sides that add several critical millimeters to the width of the phone. Not with this phone. The curved display not only looks amazing, but serves to give the phone a very compact footprint for the 5.5"" screen you are getting.That being said, there are things I don't like. Samsung still needs to make their software more stable and less energy inefficient. The longevity is more a virtue of the large battery than the software. Additionally the software can sometimes have funny quirks. Nothing too bad, but just things that are a little weird or slow sometimes.I also recommend that you buy a case for this phone. More than anything else on the market it's a work of art and you'll want to preserve it. I personally recommend this: Spigen Thin Fit Galaxy S7 Edge Case with SF Coated Non Slip Matte Surface for Excellent Grip for Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge 2016 - Black. This case is thin and almost feels like it isn't there. It'll make your phone easier to grip and give you piece of mind while you're out all day with it.","864","Samsung","8"

Now the phone is presenting a hardware problem which was already acknowledged by Samsung that it is a factory problem, what means, they know it is their problem and that they are supposed to get it fixed or exchanged. However, because it is an ""Unlocked International Version"", no Samsung authorized service would even touch the phone. Not even if I am paying for the service. So, now I have a USD 800 paper weight worth nothing at all. I hope Samsung is reading this. I have been a Samsung Loyal customer since Galaxy S II and now I am dropping this ""Loyalty"" for a Windows Phone (yeah, Windows Phone.

Samsung galaxy s7 edge Box was not sealed2. It was labelled International version at the bottom of the box and also labelled American sim only at the back of the box3. After starting the device, I noticed the bottom right corner of the screen had a little blacked out portion on the display itself. (maybe damaged item was sent)4.
